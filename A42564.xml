         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A Short Hiſtory OF THE Church of <hi>MALABAR:</hi> From the time of its being firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> in the Year <hi>1501.</hi> until the Celebration of the following Synod in the Year <hi>1599.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Country of <hi>Malabar</hi> begins at <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> a Town in the Northern <hi>Latitude</hi> of 11 degrees and 20 minutes, and ends at Cape <hi>Comorim,</hi> in the Northern <hi>Latitude</hi> of 7 degrees and ⅔ds.</p>
                  <p>It contains divers Kingdoms, as <hi>Cochim, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancor, Gundaca, Pimenta, Margate,</hi> &amp;c. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Ports, as <hi>Calecut, Cale, Cochim, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of its Princes and Nations are <hi>Heathens,</hi> and extreamly ſuperſtitious in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61585:13"/> of <hi>Pagods,</hi> of which there are ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them of incredible Riches.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Serra</hi> or <hi>Gate,</hi> as the Natives call it, is a Ridge of Mountains running 200 Leagues from North to South, the South end whereof is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by Chriſtians, who call themſelves the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of St. Thomas,</hi> upon the account of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt been converted to the Chriſtian Faith by the Apoſtle of that Name. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, or at leaſt for 1300 years, been under the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who, as their <hi>Meterane</hi> or Arch-Biſhop died, took care to ſend them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who reſided ſtill among them, and was had in great Reverence both by Chriſtians and Infidels. As for the Doctrines and Cuſtoms of this Church, I ſhall referr the Reader to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts he will meet with of them in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The firſt news of this ancient, but remote Church, was brought to <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Pedral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares Cabral,</hi> who putting into <hi>Cranganor</hi> in the year 1501. and meeting there with ſeveral of thoſe Chriſtians, he perſwaded two of them, who were Brothers, to come along with him to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> where the eldeſt, whoſe Name was <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> died at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and the other, whoſe Name was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> went firſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> where, upon his information, a Tract was publiſh'd in <hi>Latin</hi> of the State of the Church of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and is printed at the end of <hi>Faſcicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Temporum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61585:13"/>
                  <p>The year following the Chriſtians of <hi>St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> hearing of <hi>Don Vaſco da Gama</hi> being at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim,</hi> with a conſiderable Fleet of Ships, ſent ſome of their Body to let him know, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he was a Subject of a Chriſtian King, they beg'd the favour of him to take them under his Maſters Protection, that ſo they might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the Oppreſſions and Injuries which were done them daily by <hi>Infidel</hi> Princes, and for a laſting Teſtimony of their having put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> they ſent his Majeſty a Rod tipp'd at both ends with Silver, with three little Bells at the head of it, which had been the Sceptre of their Chriſtian Kings, for ſuch they are reported to have had formerly, tho' upon no very good grounds, ſo far as I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral <hi>Vaſco da Gama,</hi> not being in a condition at that time, to do any more for them, gave them a great many good words, promiſing them, in his Maſters name, the favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they had deſired, and which he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſtood in great need of.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1505 two Chriſtians, who were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their great skill in caſting great Guns, and whom, for that reaſon, <hi>Don Vaſco da Gama</hi> had taken along with him to the <hi>Indies,</hi> ran o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the <hi>Samorim,</hi> and were the firſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd the uſe of Artillery among the <hi>Malabars:</hi> For the <hi>Venetians</hi> foreſeeing that their great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Trade would be utterly ruin'd, by the new Paſſage that was diſcover'd to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61585:14"/> 
                     <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> if the <hi>Portugueze</hi> ſhou'd once get any footing in thoſe parts, are ſaid to have ſent thoſe two Engineers, who were their natural born Subjects, into the <hi>Portugueze</hi> ſervice, on purpoſe to go over to the <hi>Indians,</hi> to teach them the uſe of Great Guns, and other Fire-arms, that they might be the better able to oppoſe the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after this forementioned Complement of the Admiral, we hear no more of theſe Chriſtians, till about the Year 1545, the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> being all that while too buſie in making new Conqueſts, and the Friars, who were ſent thither, too much employed in building and providing commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seats for their Convents, to attend to any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Buſineſs, of what nature ſoever.</p>
                  <p>This 40 Years neglect of a Chriſtianity, which was juſt under their Noſes, puts me in mind of what a Miniſter of State ſaid of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Zeal in the <hi>Indies.</hi>

                  <p>Among other things there was a Copper plate found, with the following Donation engraved upon it: <hi>This is the Teſtimony of Alms, by which Paradiſe is acquired, and which all the following Kings, who ſhall diſtribute the ſaid Alms, ſhall certainly obtain: Whereas they that ſhall refuſe to give them, ſhall be Six Thouſand Years with Worms in Hell.</hi> This Imprecation is literally uſed by the ancient Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> in moſt of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Donations; but whether the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings had it from the <hi>Indian,</hi> or the <hi>Indian</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> is not certainly known.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1645. <hi>Dom Joan Dalbuquerque</hi> the firſt Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> being aſhamed, it's like, of their talking ſo much in <hi>Europe,</hi> and doing ſo little in <hi>India</hi> in the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſends one <hi>Vincent,</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friar, of which Order the Arch-Biſhop himſelf was, to <hi>Cranganor,</hi> to try what he could do towards the reducing of thoſe Chriſtians to the obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The Labours of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61585:16"/> ſingle Friar are ſo ſtrangely magnified by the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> that it looks as if it were done on purpoſe to excuſe their not employing of more Hands in a Work, which here in <hi>Europe</hi> they pretended was their chief Buſineſs in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> For he is ſaid not only to have preached daily in their Churches, which were built af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion of the <hi>Pagod</hi> Temples, but alſo to have built ſeveral Churches among them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Latin</hi> way; and at laſt, by the order of the Vice-Roy and Archbiſhop, upon his having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd them of the ſmall ſucceſs that his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had had among them, to have erected a College at <hi>Cranganor</hi> in the Year 1546. in order to the inſtructing of their Sons in the Learning and Uſages of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>By the way, It is ſomewhat ſtrange how Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar <hi>Vincent,</hi> who is not ſaid to have had the gift of Tongues, no more than the Jeſuite <hi>Xavier,</hi> who himſelf complained, That for want of it he was forc'd to prattle more like a Child, than preach like an Apoſtle among the <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſhou'd commence ſo powerful a Preacher among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> the very firſt Year of his being in the <hi>Indies;</hi> a Year being a very ſhort time for a Man to make himſelf ſo far Maſter of a ſtrange Language, as to be able to Preach therein to any purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> did not deny to ſend their Sons to this College, ſeveral of whom, after their having been taught <hi>Latin,</hi> were Ordained Prieſts, according to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61585:17"/> Rites: Yet this had little or no effect as to the reducing of that Church to the Papal Obedience, to which they ſtill continued ſo averſe, that they treated thoſe Natives with the ſame diſregard that they did the other <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus matters continued with the Church of <hi>Malabar</hi> till the Year 1587. when the Jeſuits i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining the reaſon why this Chriſtianity was ſo little benefitted by having ſeveral of their Sons bred in the College at <hi>Cranganor,</hi> was their not being taught <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> which is the Language all their Offices are in, did thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on erect a new College, which was built at the ſole charge of <hi>Antonio Guedes Morales,</hi> at a place called <hi>Chanota,</hi> or <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> a Village inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by thoſe Chriſtians, and which is about a League from <hi>Cranganor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the Jeſuits, by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſeveral of the <hi>Malabars</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue, and inſtructing them thorowly in the <hi>Latin</hi> Faith, did qualify them to ſerve the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in her Pretenſions. Yet all this ſignified very little, none that had been educated by them daring ſo much as to mutter the leaſt Word againſt any of their ancient Doctrines, or in favour of the <hi>Roman,</hi> or to alter any thing in their Offices, or forbear praying for the Biſhop of <hi>Babylon</hi> as their Patriarch, in the <hi>Maſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> finding that theſe Chriſtians were not by any thing that Friars could ſay or do to them, to be perſwaded out of their ancient Faith, or to forſake their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61585:17"/> Biſhop to ſubmit themſelves to the Pope, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they were ſo poſſeſſed, that they cou'd not endure ſo much as to hear him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, reſolved, at laſt, to try other methods with them, that is, to try what Violence would do, the Method to which Popery, where-ever it is, owes both its Propagation and Eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>And that they did not betake themſelves to this courſe ſooner, we are not to imagine was in the leaſt owing to their temper, or to any diſpoſition that was in them, to try firſt what fair and gentle means would do; for they muſt know nothing of the <hi>Spirit of Popery,</hi> that can imagine it to be capable of any ſuch thing, but it was owing purely to the circumſtances of their Affairs; for that before their Government had ſpread it ſelf, and taken a good root in thoſe Parts, it would not have been ſafe for them to have made uſe of thoſe rude and boiſterous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the reduction of theſe Chriſtians, which we ſhall ſee they did afterwards, when they had in a manner gotten that whole Countrey into their own Power: In purſuance of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Reſolution, the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have their Biſhop, to whoſe preſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them they attributed their conſtancy in their ancient Faith, ſeized in order to ſend him to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was executed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Their Biſhop at that time (for they had but one of that Order among them) was one <hi>Mar Joſeph,</hi> who, according to ancient Cuſtom, had been ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                     <hi>Babylon.</hi> He is acknowledged by the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> to have reformed divers Abuſes in that Church, and to have put things in a much better order than he found them in. <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> being brought Priſoner from <hi>Cochim</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked upon the firſt Ships that went to <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> with an intent of ſending him to <hi>Rome;</hi> but being arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he, by his Addreſs and appearances of an extraordinary Sanctity, did ſo far inſinuate himſelf into the favour and good opinion of <hi>Dona Caterina,</hi> who was Queen Regent at that time, and of the Infanta <hi>Dona Maria,</hi> that he was ſent back by the next Ships to <hi>Goa,</hi> with the Queen Regents Letters, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be permitted to live quietly in his Biſhoprick, he having promiſed the Cardinal Infante <hi>Don Anrique,</hi> who was at that time <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor-General,</hi> and the Pope's Legate <hi>à latere</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to do all that was in his power towards the reducing of his Dioceſs to the <hi>Roman</hi> obedience.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1552, one <hi>Tum Siud,</hi> or <hi>Simon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacan,</hi> a Monk of the Order of St. <hi>Pachomius,</hi> who pretended to have been choſe Patriarch of <hi>Moſul,</hi> or <hi>Seleucia Parthorum,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> for they are all the ſame by the whole Clergy of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> and ſubmitted himſelf to the Pope; by whom, according to ſome, he was conſecrated a Biſhop, tho' others will have it, that he had only his Eaſtern Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confirmed, and afterwards received the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Pallium.</hi> He preſented Letters and a

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as if they had been writ by a Paraſite Canoniſt; which Letters, together with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, were done into Latin and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Maſius:</hi> He gave out alſo, that he was attended by Seventy Perſons of note as far as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from thence only by Three, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one died by the way, and another remained ſick in the Journey; and the third, whoſe name was <hi>Calafi,</hi> came with him to <hi>Rome. Tum Siud,</hi> after he was diſmiſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Babylon,</hi> went and lived in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place called <hi>Charamet</hi> or <hi>Amed,</hi> where in a ſhort time he was put to death by the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans;</hi> and, as it is ſaid, at the inſtigation of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe Parts, who, to the great diſcredit of the pretenſions he had made at <hi>Rome,</hi> would never own him nor his Authority. But this ill Succeſs did not hinder another Monk of the ſame Order, whoſe name was <hi>Abd Jeſu</hi> or <hi>Hebed,</hi> who had writ ſeveral Books in defence of <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> from coming to <hi>Rome</hi> with the ſame pretenſions, in the Year 1562; and he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have come in a better time, by reaſon of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> being then ſitting, to which he was ſent with great Solemnity to repreſent nothing leſs than all the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Biſhops, having before at <hi>Rome</hi> in their Name, made the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that whole Church to the <hi>Pope:</hi> This method of making a noiſe with <hi>Mock-Prelates,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61585:19"/> had been made great uſe of by ſome former <hi>Popes.</hi> So <hi>Eugenius</hi> the IV. maintained his tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering reputation againſt the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> by an appearance of <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> in the Council of <hi>Florence:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> the III. gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Tranſlation of the Council from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bolongia,</hi> which was ſo ſtoutly oppoſed by the Emperor and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, by ſending one <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> to <hi>Bolognia</hi> with the ſplendid Title of the <hi>Armenian Patriarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Humor was carried on by one <hi>Elias,</hi> who likewiſe pretended to be choſe Patriarch of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> he ſent ſeveral <hi>Nuncio's</hi> to the Pope with the Submiſſion of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Church, and a Confeſſion of Faith; but theſe <hi>Nuncio's</hi> ſpoiled their buſineſs by over-acting their Parts; for it having been diſcovered, that the better to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Pretence of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Church agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all things, they had tore ſeveral Pages out of their Church-Offices, they were diſmiſſed with diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>However this did not diſcourage <hi>Elias</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what will a hungry Monk?) from ſending one <hi>Adam Camara,</hi> his pretended Arch-Deacon, to <hi>Rome,</hi> three Years after that misfortune; who, together with his Patriarch's Letter, delivered to the Pope a Book of his own compoſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reconciliation of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Church to the <hi>Roman,</hi> which he deſired might be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examined. In his Letter he told <hi>Paul</hi> V. <hi>That let Hereticks do what they will, he for his part was reſolved never to go againſt the Holy Precepts of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61585:19"/> the Apoſtles and Orthodox Fathers, who had all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the</hi> See <hi>of great</hi> Rome <hi>to be the Head of all other</hi> Sees, <hi>but would always confeſs that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was the Mother of all the other Churches in the World, and that all that did not own her to be ſo, were accurſed.</hi> It's obſervable, that this <hi>Elias</hi> had a ſtretch of Courtſhip beyond his begging Predeceſſors; which was his aſſuring the Pope, That all their Clergy anciently had their Orders immediately from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that that Cuſtom continued, till ſeveral that were going to <hi>Rome</hi> on that Errand were murdered by the way; which having ſeveral times happened, the Pope when he came to hear of it, did of his free Grace ſay, <hi>Let us ordain them a Patriarch; and not only ſo, but permit them to chuſe him, that ſo they may not periſh thus by the way:</hi> And thus, ſaid good <hi>Elias,</hi> we received all the Authority we pretend to from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not from our ſelves, as they pretend to do; (and the greater Wretches they) who trample upon the Canons of the Apoſtles, and the Laws of the Fathers. It is from this blind Story that the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade the World, that all the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> Biſhops do own, that they derived their Power of Ordination from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Fathers, meaning the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> no doubt.</p>
                  <p>Now what crude Stuff is this, that thoſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. Monks ſerved up to the Pope, and was as greedily ſwallowed at <hi>Rome,</hi> there being not the leaſt Colour of Truth in any part of the Story. For as to the ancient Cuſtom that is ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61585:20"/> affirmed, it is plainly contradicted by the 33d <hi>Arabick</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which tho' not the genuine Canons of that Council, are yet very ancient. The Canon runs thus:
<q>
                        <hi>Canon 33.</hi> Let the See of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> which is one of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Cities, be honoured likewiſe, and have the Title of <hi>Catholicon,</hi> and let the Prelate thereof, ordain Arch-Biſhops as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patriarchs do, that ſo the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who live under Heathens, may not be wronged by waiting the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi>'s leiſure, or by going to him, but may have a way opened to them to ſupply their own Neceſſities; neither will any injury be done to the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> thereby, ſeeing he has conſented to its being thus, upon the Synod's having deſired it of him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which Canon it is plain, That the Church of <hi>Seleucia</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> was anciently ſubject to the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who of all the Patriarchs was their nigheſt Neighbour. So that if the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> Biſhops do own that they derived all their Authority from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Fathers, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they do, they muſt mean by the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Fathers, the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch.</hi>

                  <p>And as to its being ſaid, That the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops do to this day own that they had their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Fathers, meaning the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> the falſhood of that Pretence appears evidently, not only from what has been
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61585:20"/> ſaid, but from the whole Tenor of the following Synod, and of all the late Reports of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes</hi> concerning that Church: As it does like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, That all thoſe Patriarchs of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithſtanding the great Noiſe they made in this Part of the World, were mere Impoſtors, never owned by the Churches they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Patriarchs of. Father <hi>Simon</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this in the 93 Page of his <hi>Hiſtoire Critique,</hi> confeſſeth their magnifying the Pope's Power as they did, to have been a piece of groſs Flattery, but withal, will have it to have been Pardonable in ſuch poor Wretches, who would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been ſuffered to have approached the Pope, to whom they came into <hi>Europe</hi> on purpoſe to make their Court; for, as he obſerves upon the ſame occaſion, few or none of the Oriental Prelates ever applied themſelves to the Pope, but for the promoting of ſome particular Intereſt, which was one reaſon why the reunions they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make did not laſt long. But tho' for ſome time theſe <hi>mock Prelates</hi> being ſupported by the Pope, made a ſhift to keep the face of a Church at <hi>Charamet,</hi> none of them ever daring to go to <hi>Moſul,</hi> yet after a little time the true <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> Prelates obliged them to leave <hi>Charamet;</hi> from whence they retired to <hi>Zeinalback,</hi> a yet remoter Place on the borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where from little, in a ſhort time, they dwindled to nothing.</p>
                  <p>The Prelates of <hi>Babylon</hi> we ſee were anciently ſtiled Biſhops of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> a City not far from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61585:21"/> 
                     <hi>Cteſiphon;</hi> from whence it was that <hi>Simon,</hi> who ſuffered Martyrdom under <hi>Sapor</hi> is ſtiled Biſhop of <hi>Seleucia</hi> and <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> of which City we meet with this following Account in <hi>Strabo.</hi> Babylon <hi>was anciently the Metropolis of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>which now</hi> Seleucia <hi>of</hi> Tigris <hi>is, near to which is a great Village called</hi> Cteſiphon, <hi>where the Kings of</hi> Parthia <hi>uſed to ſpend the Winter to ſpare</hi> Seleucia, <hi>that it might not be continually oppreſſed with Soldiers and</hi> Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>but notwithſtanding this Change of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, as the Country all about is ſtill called</hi> Babylon, <hi>ſo the Natives, tho' Born in the very City of</hi> Seleucia, <hi>are ſtill called</hi> Babylonians <hi>from the Region, and not</hi> Seleucians.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> there is a Treatiſe of Paradiſe tranſlated out of <hi>Syriack</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> by <hi>Maſius,</hi> writ by one <hi>Moſes Bar Cepha,</hi> who is ſtiled Biſhop in <hi>Bethraman</hi> and <hi>Bethleno,</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs of the Mozul</hi> or <hi>Seleucia Parthorum.</hi> This <hi>Moſes</hi> flouriſhed in the Tenth Century.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to leave theſe <hi>Sham Prelates,</hi> who run ſo faſt to <hi>Rome</hi> of their own accord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the true ones, who were forc'd to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much againſt their Wills.</p>
                  <p>After the Chriſtians of the <hi>Serra</hi> had heard of their Arch-Biſhop's being ſent a Priſoner to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> deſpairing of ever ſeeing him again, they ſent ſecretly to <hi>Mar Simeon,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> deſiring him to order them a new Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who ſtraightways ſent them one <hi>Mar Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who having gotten into the <hi>Serra</hi> in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61585:21"/> notwithſtanding the great care the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> had taken to have intercepted him, he was received by the whole Church as their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, with great joy. But he had not been long there, before he had the news of <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi>'s being returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> where having preſented the Letters he had brought along with him, he was permitted to go back to his Biſhoprick.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa</hi> who had writ to <hi>Portugal,</hi> that they ſhould by no means ever ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> to return to the <hi>Indies,</hi> was not without ſtrong jealouſies of his having prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in all that he had promiſed; and what did very much confirm him therein, was, that <hi>Mar Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> when he deſired him to take ſome Friars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him to preach the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrines in his Biſhoprick, did not only deny to do it, but furthermore pretended, that it was reveal'd to him the Night before, that it was no ways convenient. The Arch-Biſhop being netled at this pretence, told him with great heat, That he had better Revelation from the Scriptures of his not being the Paſtor whom God would have to feed his Sheep, but a Wolf in Sheep's cloathing, of whom our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>That they were to be known by their Fruits,</hi> and that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> would quickly be ſenſible how much they had been impoſed upon by him.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, he was permitted to go to his Biſhoprick, tho' for no other reaſon, its like, but to give birth to a Schiſm, by which means the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> hoped to be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61585:22"/> their ends upon that Church the eaſier, <hi>Divide &amp; impera,</hi> being a piece of Policy that is well underſtood, and has been much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And if this was their drift in ſending him back to his Dioceſs, they were not out in their Policy, for <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> was not ſooner in the <hi>Serra,</hi> than the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick was divided, ſome adhering to <hi>Mar A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and others to <hi>Mar Joſeph,</hi> as their true Prelate.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> finding <hi>Mar Abraham</hi>'s Party to be much the more numerous, by reaſon of the Communication he had had with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> did thereupon betake himſelf to the courſe that all diſtreſſed People, who preferr their own Intereſt to that of the Publick, take, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> of <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> not only as an Uſurper, but as a moſt bitter Enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy,</hi> who was glad of this occaſion, ſtraightways diſpatch'd an Order to the Governour of <hi>Cochim,</hi> to have <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> apprehended, and to ſend him Priſoner to <hi>Goa,</hi> in order to ſend him to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But the Ship whereon <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> was Embarked, being forced by ſtreſs of Weather into <hi>Mazambique,</hi> a Port belonging to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> in the Southern Coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> he made a ſhift to eſcape, and by the way of <hi>Melindo</hi> and <hi>Ormus,</hi> to get to the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whom having received new Briefs to Fortifie his Title, he reſolved to return to his Biſhoprick;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61585:22"/> but having afterwards conſidered better on the matter, and being ſenſible, that if he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Order, that the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> would quickly make the Serra too hot for him, he altered his Mind, and reſolved to try his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to take a Journey thither over Land; being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> after having abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ancient Faith, and reconciled himſelf to the Church, and promiſed to reduce that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar</hi> to its obedience, he obtained of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, all ſuch <hi>Briefs</hi> as were any ways neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, having alſo the Title of <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> which he and his Predeceſſors had enjoyed, given him therein.</p>
                  <p>But being at <hi>Venice,</hi> in his way home, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines there diſcovering, as it is ſaid, both from the Nature of the Opinions that he had abjured, and from his own Confeſſion, that he had never been lawfully Ordained, did oblige him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all <hi>Orders,</hi> from the <hi>firſt tonſure</hi> to the <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> He was ordained <hi>Prieſt</hi> by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>St. Salvador</hi> and Conſecrated a <hi>Biſhop</hi> by the Patriarch of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Venetian</hi> Conſecration, if it is not a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Naggs-Head</hi> Story, is a Scurvy reflection upon the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Infallibility, who herein was not only deceived in a <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> in giving <hi>Briefs</hi> to one, as an Arch-Biſhop, who really was not at all in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> but he muſt alſo have been deceived in a <hi>matter of Doctrine,</hi> in being Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that ſome of the Opinions which had been Abjured before him by <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> were of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61585:23"/> ſuch a nature as to incapacitate him for <hi>Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> was in this Voyage, <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> finding himſelf in the quiet Poſſeſſion of his whole Biſhoprick, did not forbear to profeſs and teach the Doctrines he had abjured in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Cochim,</hi> who was his next Neighbour, having heard thereof, acquainted the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa</hi> therewith, and he <hi>Don Anrique,</hi> the Cardinal Infante, who at that time Governed <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Minority of his Nephew <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and the Cardinal informed the Pope of the whole matter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe repeated Tyrannies of the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> of dragging ancient Biſhops thus out of their own Country and Dioceſs, and tumbling them ſo about the World, I cannot but reckon among thoſe violent Injuſtices for which <hi>Manuel de Faria</hi> in the very laſt words of his <hi>Aſia Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſa,</hi> tells us, God has puniſhed them ſo viſibly. The obſervation is ſo remarkable, and to this day ſo litterally true, as I have been told by ſeveral intelligent <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> that I ſhall ſet it down in the Author's own words. <q rend="margDblQuotes">Ponderacion muy notable ay en eſto, y es, que dequanta perſona paſſaran a la India ya como Governadores, ya como Capitanes, ya como Mercadores, aunque eſto ultimo ſiempre fue de todos: y de quantos deſtos alcançaran groeſſiſſimas haziendas, no ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve oy in el Reyno de Portugal ninguna caſa o Mayo razgo que ſe fundaſſe con ellas, o lo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos que ſea coſa de importancia: ni tam poco ay en la India alguna caſa grande deſta calidad:

                     <q rend="italic">It is remarkable, that among all the Perſons who have gone to the <hi>Indies,</hi> whether as Governours, Captains, or Merchants, of which ſort moſt of them were in truth, there has not been one that has raiſed a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of any conſideration out of the Goods they have got in thoſe Parts, either there or in <hi>Portugal,</hi> tho' there have been ſeveral of them that have got there, one, two, three, or four Millions.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61585:24"/> any regard to Religion; the other is, becauſe the moſt of thoſe Riches were gained by the unjuſt means of Tyrannies, Robberies, and all ſort of Inſolencies, of which you have many Inſtances in the foregoing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</q>

                     <hi>Pius</hi> V. upon this Iſſued forth a <hi>Brief,</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date the 15th. of <hi>January</hi> 1567. directing it to <hi>Dom Jorge,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to uſe all diligence to have <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> forthwith Apprehended and ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> in purſuance whereof he was ſeized, and ſent Priſoner to <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon the firſt Ships that went, whence he was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he died.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the Violences they made uſe of to Convert <hi>Infidels,</hi> any whit inferior to thoſe they exerciſed upon the poor <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Chriſtians, by which they came to provoke the <hi>Infidel</hi> Princes to that degree, that they had like to have loſt all that they had in the <hi>Indies</hi> by it. For the <hi>Hidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caon</hi> who Beſieged <hi>Goa</hi> in the Year 1570. both in his Letters to the Viceroy <hi>Don Luis d' Ataide,</hi> and in the Speech he made to his Captains, when he firſt communicated to them his deſign of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> gave thoſe Violences for the chief cauſe of his War. Thoſe Letters and Speech being too long to be here Inſerted, I ſhall only ſet down ſo much of them as relates directly to this matter.</p>
                  <p>In his firſt Letter to the <hi>Viceroy,</hi> after having complained of ſome other Grievances, he tells him, <hi>That he was certainly informed that at</hi> Ormus,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61585:24"/> Dio, Chaul, <hi>and all the other</hi> Portugueze <hi>Ports, his Subjects Ships were all ſtrictly ſearched, and all the Boys and Girls that were found Aboard, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Quality,</hi> Abyſſnes <hi>or</hi> Mahometans, <hi>were forcibly carried aſhoar, and there detained from their Parents or Maſters. This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is a matter that I cannot but be extreamly offended with; neither can I judge otherwiſe of your permitting ſuch Violences, but that you have a mind to break with me, for if you had not I cannot be perſwaded that your People durſt preſume to commit ſuch Inſolencies:</hi> He goes on. <hi>Let it ſuffice that no difference can happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, but what gives me great diſpleaſure, and that I am both a Brother and an Allie of the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and do eſteem you as my particular Friend, to put a ſtop to this matter, that ſo my Subjects may have no further cauſe to complain thereof. Beſides, I am confident the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>will not thank any, that ſhall be inſtrumental in making a Breach between me and him, by compelling my Subjects thus againſt their Wills to turn Chriſtians, a practice,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that's abominable in the ſight of all the World; nay, I am confident that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>himſelf, the God whom you adore, cannot be well pleaſed with ſuch Service as this: Force and Compulſion in all ſuch Caſes, being what God, Kings, and all the People of the World do abominate. The work of turning People from one Religion to another, if it be not done by the Divine Inſpiration, and the immediate Will of God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſincere, neither can</hi> Converts <hi>have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſpect for a Religion, which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to Profeſs. I do thetefore intreat you to ſee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61585:25"/> that this matter be ſpeedily redreſſed, but eſpecially that of taking Peoples Children from them by violence, which is a thing I ſtand amazed at, and am in duty bound to ſee remedied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his ſecond Letter he thanks the <hi>Viceroy</hi> for an Order he had ſent to <hi>Ormus,</hi> and the other <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ports, prohibiting all ſuch Violences, but at the ſame time tells him, <hi>That his Order was not in the leaſt regarded; for that the</hi> Portuguezes <hi>notwithſtanding it, went on ſtill in their former Courſes,</hi> to which he tells him, <hi>If there were not a ſpeedy and effectual ſtop put, it muſt neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a War betwixt him and the</hi> Portuguezes; adding, <hi>That as he knew that neither God, nor wiſe Kings, took any delight in Diſcords, ſo he was certain that there was no Religion in the World, that juſtified the forcing of People from one Religion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in his Speech to his Captains he tells them, <hi>The</hi> Portuguezes <hi>at firſt came among us, under the notion of Merchants, promiſing to help us to ſeveral Goods that we wanted, but that afterwards by making of trifling Preſents to ſome weak Princes and other Arts, they had obtained leave to build Store-Houſes for their Wares upon the Coaſt; but that inſtead of Ware-Houſes, they had built Fortreſſes, by which means they had ſtrengthned themſelves ſo in</hi> India, <hi>both by Sea and Land, that it was more than time for the Natives to look about them, and to join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to extirpate ſuch cruel Tyrants and Ravagers of ſo many Kingdoms, and Enemies to the general quiet and commerce of the World; and that for one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61585:25"/> thing eſpecially, which was what no patience was able to endure, their compelling the</hi> Indians <hi>in all places, where they had Power, to change their Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Affair the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Mahometan,</hi> of which Sect this <hi>Hidalcaon</hi> was, ſeem to have changed Parts, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> writing therein like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Pudet haec opprobria nobis</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>About this time the <hi>Dominican Friars,</hi> under pretence of building a Convent, built a Fortreſs at <hi>Solor,</hi> into which, as ſoon as it was finiſhed, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> put a ſtrong Garriſon: There were perpetual Bickerings betwixt this Garriſon and the Natives, in moſt of which, ſome of the <hi>Friars,</hi> as they were Converting thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> with Swords in their hands, ſuffered Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>We read of a famous <hi>Portugueze Miſſionary</hi> about this time, it was one <hi>Fernando Vinagre,</hi> who, tho' a Secular Prieſt, Commanded the Squadron that was ſent to the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore;</hi> in which occaſion he is ſaid to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf both like a great Captain, and a great Apoſtle, and to have appeared one day in <hi>Armour,</hi> and another in a <hi>Surplice,</hi> and to have Baptized ſeveral in his Armour, with his <hi>Surplice</hi> over it. In theſe <hi>a la Dragoon</hi> Converſions, he was ſeconded by his Admiral <hi>Antonio Galvam,</hi> who with the aſſiſtance of Captain <hi>Franciſco de
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61585:26"/> Caſtro,</hi> is ſaid to have Converted five Kings in the Iſland of <hi>Mazacar;</hi> and tho' he was really no other than a <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> yet he is ſaid by the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Hiſtorians to be another <hi>St. Paul,</hi> in Governing all that came under his Power both with his Sword and with his Voice, <hi>A Sword and Voice,</hi> ſay they, <hi>worthy of a glorious Eternity.</hi> It was this <hi>Antonio</hi> that firſt diſcovered the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s ſpecial Title to the <hi>Clove,</hi> which, for having five Points, he ſaid, had the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Arms, which are the five Wounds of Chriſt ſtamp'd upon it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author tells us, and approves of what an <hi>Indian</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> when in the height of their Triumphs: <hi>Let them alone,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Indian, for they will quickly come to loſe that as Covetous Merchants, which they have gained as admirable Soldiers; they now Conquer</hi> Aſia, <hi>but it will not be long before</hi> Aſia <hi>will Conquer them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperor of <hi>Perſia</hi> is reported by the ſame Author to have made the ſame Prediction, who being told by the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ambaſſador, when he asked him how many of the Governours of the <hi>Indies</hi> Heads his Maſter had chopped off, that he had not taken off one, replied, <hi>If that is true, it is not poſſible the</hi> Portuguezes <hi>ſhould hold the</hi> Indies <hi>long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> were driven out of the Iſland of <hi>Ito</hi> by the <hi>Natives.</hi> They were ſtirred up to do it by a Speech made by one <hi>Gemulio,</hi> a conſiderable <hi>Native,</hi> wherein he told the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> in a full Aſſembly of them, <hi>That if they Preached to others that there was a God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61585:26"/> in Heaven, who obſerved all that was done on Earth, and would certainly Reward all Good, and Puniſh all Evil-Deeds, without believing it themſelves, or without practiſing what they believed, they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly guilty of the Abomination, which ſuch a God muſt deteſt above all others:</hi> He likewiſe told them, <hi>They were Strangers come from the very Skirts of the World, and will you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who are the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the Shades, which the Sun leaves when it goes down, preſume to Tyrannize over us, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained you ſo kindly, and have been ſo long a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to you? If theſe be the Cuſtoms of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, you muſt know they are what we Abominate; return, return therefore to your native darkneſs, or your ancient Habitations, where the want of Light will hide your Actions, and do you not come hither to commit them in the very apple of the Eye of the Sun, as it riſeth out of his brighteſt Cradle. You preach</hi> Chriſt Crucified <hi>to us, and at the ſame time Crucifie thoſe you have perſwaded to believe in him. You will make others to be</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be ſuch your ſelves.

                  <p>When <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> returned to <hi>Goa</hi> over Land, by the way of <hi>Ormus,</hi> and found <hi>Mar Joſeph</hi> Shipped off for <hi>Portugal,</hi> thereupon he flattered himſelf with the hopes of meeting with nothing to moleſt him in the Poſſeſſion of his Biſhoprick; but he quickly found himſelf decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for having preſented the Pope's <hi>Briefs,</hi> and other Papers he brought along with him to the Arch-Biſhop, the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> not having the ſame reaſon to permit him to return to the <hi>Serra,</hi> as they had when they permitted <hi>Mar Joſeph,</hi> which, as I have obſerved, was done on purpoſe to give riſe to a Schiſm, he was told, that before they would put him in Poſſeſſion of his Biſhoprick, they muſt firſt have both the <hi>Briefs</hi> and his <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> ſtrictly examined, that ſo they might be ſatisfied he had not impoſed upon his <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, tho' reſolved whatever came on't, never to let <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> go out of their hands, yet that they might not ſeem to refuſe to pay a due reſpect to the <hi>Pope's Briefs;</hi> the Arch-Biſhop and others, after having examined all his Papers, found ſeveral flaws in them, which were declared to be ſufficient to juſtifie their detaining of him: This is no more than what the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> can do, and do daily in the cleareſt caſes, it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have any Matrimonial or other cauſe drawn up, or worded ſo accurately, that the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61585:27"/> and eſpecially if the Pope deſire it, will not find ſeveral Nullities in. Upon the publication of the nullity of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Briefs,</hi> as having been obtained by miſinformation, poor <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> inſtead of being ſent back in Triumph to his Biſhoprick, as he expected, was, after all the Pains he had been at, confined to the <hi>Dominican</hi> Convent at <hi>Goa,</hi> there to remain till ſuch time as the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Anſwer came to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his Caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> being ſenſible that to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined till that came, was the ſame thing as to be condemned to be a Priſoner for Life, reſolved, let what would be the Iſſue, to try to make his eſcape, which, after ſeveral unſucceſsful Attempts, he did, at laſt, upon an <hi>Holy Thurſday</hi> at Night, while the <hi>Friars</hi> were all imployed in the Chapel, and having gotten over to the Continent, he poſted away to <hi>Malabar,</hi> where he was received with great Joy and Feſtivity by all the Chriſtians, who having two of their Arch-Biſhops Priſoners among the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> deſpaired of ever ſeeing another <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Biſhop among them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi> and <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Mar Abraham</hi>'s having made his eſcape thus, and writ ſtraightways to the Biſhop of <hi>Cochim,</hi> and all the Governours upon the Coaſt of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> to have him apprehended if he was above Ground; but <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> knowing how it would be, took care to keep himſelf, as far as he could, out of their reach, never adventuring to viſit any of the Churches that were in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61585:28"/> of <hi>Cochim,</hi> or of any other <hi>Portugueze</hi> Garriſon.</p>
                  <p>But tho' after this <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> is ſaid, in all his Letters to the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> to have ſtill profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> and not only ſo, but to have re-ordained all that had been ordained by him formerly; yet it is certain, that in all things elſe he acted quite otherwiſe in his Dioceſs, where he continued not only to preach his old <hi>Doctrines,</hi> but in his Prayers ſtill named the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Babylon</hi> as his Patriarch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. being informed of this by the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Goa,</hi> and other Prelates of the <hi>Indies,</hi> iſſued forth a <hi>Brief,</hi> bearing date the 28th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1578. directing it to <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> and commanding him therein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the next Provincial Council that ſhould be Aſſembled at <hi>Goa,</hi> to aſſiſt at it, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Decrees that ſhould be made therein, relating to his Biſhoprick, and that he might not excuſe his not obeying this <hi>Brief,</hi> by pretending that he could not do it with ſafety; the <hi>Pope</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent him <hi>Letters of ſafe Conduct,</hi> to go and come without being any ways moleſted.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance whereof <hi>Dom Vicente da Fonſeca,</hi> a <hi>Friar,</hi> of the Order of <hi>St. Dominick,</hi> and <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Goa,</hi> having called a Provincial Council, which was the third of <hi>Goa,</hi> ordered the forementioned <hi>Brief</hi> to be intimated to <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> and together with the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, his own, and the Viceroy's <hi>Letters of ſafe Conduct,</hi> to be ſent to him.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61585:28"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> having well conſidered the matter, and perceiving how difficult it would be for him to eſcape being Dragoon'd by the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> whoſe power increaſed daily in thoſe Parts, if he ſhould diſobey this Summons, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whatever came on it, to repair to the Council, at which he aſſiſted, and was obliged once more to Abjure, and make a profeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, promiſing withal, to ſee all the Decrees made in that <hi>Synod,</hi> in relation to his Biſhoprick, punctually executed, and to ſend in all the Heretick Books in his Dioceſs to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or amended; and having confeſſed, that in <hi>the Ordination of Prieſts</hi> there was no Wine in the Cup, which he delivered into their hands, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Hoſt, he was commanded to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain all that he had Ordained before over-again.</p>
                  <p>Now if this, of there being no Wine in the Cup, which was delivered into the hands of thoſe who were Ordained <hi>Prieſts,</hi> was the only ground whereon the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> founded the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Orders, as it is the only thing they have been pleaſed to inſtance in, what a ſtretch was this to invalidate the Orders of a whole Church by? But for <hi>Canoniſts</hi> and <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> by Subtilties invented on purpoſe to ſupport a late Error, or to ſerve a preſent turn, to wound Chriſtianity in its very Vitals, is a practice too common to be wondred at. I am ſure the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has much more reaſon to apprehend that the Sacrilege of denying the Cup to the Laity
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61585:29"/> in the Sacrament, may make her Communion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and ineffectual, than that this alone ſhould make Ordinations ſo.</p>
                  <p>But after all this ſtir, the Doctrine of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Bread and Cup into the hands of thoſe who are to be ordained Prieſts, being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to Orders, is ſo far from being true, that it is owned to be a Novelty by all the Modern Learned Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is moreover contradicted by her daily Practice, who, as all the World knows, allows the <hi>Greek Orders</hi> to be good, in the Collation whereof ſhe knows, the Bread and Cup is not put into the hands of thoſe who are ordained Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> ſeems to have doted into the ſame Error with this of the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> in making that new Ceremony eſſential to <hi>Orders.</hi> But let that be as it will, it is certain that both the preſent practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and all her truly Learned <hi>Sons,</hi> the Modern <hi>Schoolmen</hi> not excepted, do condemn it as an Error; for which I ſhall only quote two of her moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Schoolmen, and one of her ableſt Criticks.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Lugo,</hi> in his 2 Diſp. <hi>de Sacramentis,</hi> ſaith as followeth, <hi>Aliunde autem habemus, non porrectionem panis &amp; vini determinatè requiri ex divinâ inſtitutione, cum Graeci abſque illâ porrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ordinentur; ergo fatendum eſt Chriſtum ſolum voluiſſe pro materiâ aliquod ſignum proportionatum hoc vel illud.</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>Becanus,</hi> in the third part of his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical Divinity, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. of the Sacrament of Order, has as follows: <hi>Concilium Florentinum in inſtructione Armenorum ſolum meminit materiae acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentalis, quae ab Eccleſiâ fuit inſtituta,</hi> which was the delivering of the Bread and Cup, <hi>non autem ſubſtantialis, quam Chriſtus praeſcripſit,</hi> which is the impoſition of hands, <hi>Quia haec ex Scripturis &amp; antiquis Patribus erat ſatis cognita, non autem illa. Addo, ſi hoc argumentum valeret, poſſe optimè retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queri ita, Antiqua concilia non aſſignant aliam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam niſi impoſitionem manuum, ergo,</hi> &amp;c.

By this one may ſee, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſo uniform a Body as ſhe pretends to be, being thus inconſiſtent with her ſelf in a thing of ſo high a nature, as that, <hi>of what is,</hi> and <hi>what is not eſſential to Orders:</hi> and we my ſee likewiſe, how ſhe will break thorow all ancient Doctrines and Rules, rather than not diſgrace all Bodies of Chriſtians, which deny her Obedience, by unchurching them by ſome ſubtilty or other; and indeed, thorow the cleareſt evidences of matter of Fact, as ſhe does in the caſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, how apt ſhe is to look upon her own novel Inventions as the main Subſtantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>To whom I ſhall only add <hi>Morinus,</hi> whoſe judgment in a caſe of this nature is of more

There were ſeveral others of thoſe Prieſts and Biſhops who attempted to get into the <hi>Serra</hi> in the Habit of Mariners, were ſtopt, to the great Grief of the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who, the more they ſaw their Clergy Perſecuted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected them the more, and grew every day more zealous for their ancient Doctrines and Rites.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop being much encouraged by the Succeſs of this diligence, laid the matter of the reduction of this Church to the obedience of the <hi>Roman,</hi> much more to Heart than any of his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61585:33"/> Predeceſſors had ever done. The firſt he applied himſelf to was <hi>Jacob,</hi> whom <hi>Mar Simeon</hi> had left his <hi>Vicar General,</hi> to whom he writ a long Letter, paſſionately entreating him to throw away the Commiſſion he had from <hi>Mar Simeon,</hi> who was Convicted at <hi>Rome</hi> of not being in Holy Orders, and to ſubmit himſelf to the <hi>Papal Authority;</hi> making him large Promiſes of what he would do for him, if he complied with his deſires. But <hi>Jacob,</hi> who died preſently after, was deaf to all the Arch-Biſhop could ſay to him, making it his whole buſineſs to enflame his Flock againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and their Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop did not neglect at the ſame time to write earneſtly to <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> as alſo to the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> who is the only <hi>Dignitary</hi> in that Church under the Biſhop, and who is employed by him as his <hi>Vicar General,</hi> calling upon them to purge their Dioceſs of the Errors wherewith it had been ſo long infected, and to reduce it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Obedience.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Francis,</hi> about this time, deſtroyed a whole Fleet of <hi>Jores</hi> to the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> who, tho' he was not ſeen by any of the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> in the Fight, which was very bloody on both ſides, yet a Cook who belonged to a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Convent not far off, having hid himſelf in the Ruines of their Church, ſaw a Friar in his own Habit Board the Fleet of <hi>Jores,</hi> one after another, whom he ſo terrified with his very look, as to put them all to flight immediately, and purſued them out of ſight: This formidable Friar was afterwards
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61585:33"/> diſcovered to be St. <hi>Francis;</hi> but tho' the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian has not been pleaſed to tell us how it came to be known certainly, he tells us it was an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very proper for St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who was the lively Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to appear thus and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>It is I.</hi> Now, if this Story did not rebuild the <hi>Capuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In the Year 1584. there came a famous <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> who had been drove out of her Country by the <hi>Hidalcaon;</hi> her name was <hi>Abehi;</hi> ſhe had Fought in ſeveral Battles to admiration; and tho' when ſhe came to <hi>Goa,</hi> ſhe was 62 years of Age, ſhe is reported to have had a great deal of Wit, and the ruines of an exquiſite Beauty; ſhe pretended to have buſineſs of great moment to communicate to the Viceroy, but the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, no body knew why, put a ſtop to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; which, after having kept her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner for ſome time, baniſhed her to <hi>Ormus,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61585:34"/> from whence having made her eſcape, ſhe went to the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1593. the Bull of <hi>Cruzada</hi> was firſt brought into the <hi>Indies</hi> by <hi>Franciſco Faria,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar; and indeed conſidering how great a Revenue that Bull is to the Pope in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> it is very much that it did not find its way into the <hi>Indies</hi> ſooner.</p>
                  <p>When the Arch-Biſhop was viſiting the City of <hi>Damaon,</hi> he received Letters of the 16th. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1597. from the Viceroy <hi>Matthias Dalbuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> adviſing him of the Death of <hi>Mar Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> On the ſame day he received this news, he in obedience to the Pope's <hi>Brief,</hi> conſtituted <hi>Franciſco Roz,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and who was afterwards made Biſhop of the <hi>Serra,</hi> Governour and <hi>Vicar-Apoſtolical</hi> of the ſaid Dioceſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>May</hi> following the Arch-Biſhop being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Goa,</hi> a Conſultation was held about the Affairs of the Church of the <hi>Serra,</hi> where it was unanimouſly agreed; that notwithſtanding the Pope in his <hi>Brief</hi> had commanded none to be made Governour or <hi>Vicar Apoſtolical</hi> of the Dioceſs, but what was of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was convenient to nominate the preſent Arch-Deacon to it, which they did, joining <hi>Franciſco Roz,</hi> and the <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>-College of <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> in Commiſſion with him. But it being required of the Arch-Deacon, that he ſhou'd ſubſcribe the Profeſſion of Faith made by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. before he had his Patent he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doing it, pretending he was not ſatisfied
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61585:34"/> with having two joyned with him in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop, tho' he was ſenſible that it was the Subſcription that ſtuck with him chiefly, thought fit to diſſemble, ſo far as to ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and by a new Patent conſtituted him the ſole Governour of the Biſhoprick.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Deacon accepted of this Patent, but at the ſame time declared, That it gave him no Authority but what he had before; but when he was called upon to Subſcribe the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Profeſſion of Faith, he deſired four Months to conſider of it, hoping by that time a Biſhop might be ſent them by the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the four Months were expired. Being ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a freſh to Subſcribe, he told them flatly, that he would never do it, nor ſubmit to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which he was ſure had nothing to do with the Apoſtolical Church of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> no more than that of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had to do with the <hi>Roman.</hi> And not being ſatisfied with having made this Declaration as to himſelf, he further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more aſſembled a Synod of moſt of the Prieſts, and moſt ſubſtantial Chriſtians at <hi>Angamale,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Dioceſs, where they all ſwore to ſtand by their <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> in the defence of the ancient Faith they and their Fore-fathers had been bred up in, ſo as not to ſuffer the leaſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be made therein, nor ever to admit of any Biſhop, but what ſhould be ſent them by the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon;</hi> of all which they made a publick Inſtrument, and having Sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61585:35"/> it with their Lives and Fortunes, ordered it to be publiſhed thorow the whole Dioceſs.</p>
                  <p>After the meeting of this Synod, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> came to be ſo far enraged againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> for what they had done to deſtroy their ancient Faith, and for their having treated ſo many of their Arch-Biſhops, ſo barbarouſly as they had done, that they would ſuffer no <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſt to officiate in their Churches, nor ſo much as to live among them. Two <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> one at <hi>Angamale,</hi> and another at <hi>Carturte,</hi> having very narrowly eſcaped being murdered by them. The <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and other <hi>Latin</hi> Prieſts, were ſo far inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated, by the fury that Synod had put that whole Chriſtianity into, that for ſome time none of them were found ſo hardy, as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to go among them.</p>
                  <p>The news of this great and unexpected Heat, as it did ſtrangely afflict the Arch-Biſhop, who had ſet his Heart ſo much on the reducing of thoſe Chriſtians; ſo it was the thing that made him reſolve to go in Perſon to the <hi>Serra</hi> to try what his Preſence and Authority would do.</p>
                  <p>Not only the Viceroy, but the whole Clergy and Laity, and particularly the whole Chapter of <hi>Goa,</hi> together in a body, did all they could, as it is ſaid, to diſſwade him from ſo dangerous an enterpriſe, but tho' he was deaf to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of his Friends, yet upon a War breaking out ſuddenly in the Year 1598. betwixt the Kings of <hi>Mangate</hi> and <hi>Paru,</hi> in whoſe Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories moſt of theſe Chriſtian Churches ſtand,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61585:35"/> he thought fit to put off his Journey for that Year, ſatisfying himſelf with writing a Letter to the Arch-Deacon to perſwade him to reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Church to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his Intentions to viſit all the Churches in the <hi>Serra</hi> in Perſon, ſo ſoon as the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned War was over, which he believed would be very ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Deacon, when he received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dreading nothing ſo much as the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's coming in Perſon among them, declared that he had refuſed to Subſcribe the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Profeſſion of Faith, for no other reaſon, but becauſe he was Commanded to do it before the Rector of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> College of <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> with whom and his whole Order he pretended to be juſtly diſſatisfied, giving the Arch-Biſhop to underſtand at the ſame time, that if he would order any other Prieſt or Friar to take his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, that he was ready to make it.</p>
                  <p>But the Arch-Biſhop looking upon this only as a Trick to throw an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the whole Order of <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and that for no other reaſon, but becauſe they were the moſt induſtrious in the reduction of thoſe Chriſtians to the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, would not comply with the Arch-Deacon's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, in naming ſome body elſe to take his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; for which Conduct the Arch-Biſhop was very much blamed, moſt People, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the other Orders of Friars murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as one grown ſo fond of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as to loſe the reduction of ſo many thouſand
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61585:36"/> Souls, rather than diſpleaſe the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who ſacrifice all Intereſts and Obligations to the Honour of their Order, have requited the Arch-Biſhop but very ill for this his great kindneſs for them, in having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this Affair ſo here in <hi>Europe,</hi> as to rob him of that which he eſteemed his chief Glory, to wit, the Reduction of this Church to the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>For in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Pieire du Jarri,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in the Year 1608. we have all that is ſaid by the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> of <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> and his Arch-Deacon's great averſion to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and particularly to the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> flatly contradicted; for in that Hiſtory we are told that <hi>Mar Abraham</hi> had ſuch an extraordinary kindneſs for the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> that for ſome time before his Death, he put himſelf ſo entirely into their hands, as to be governed by them in all things; and that the Arch-Deacon <hi>George</hi> had ſuch an high Opinion of their worth, as to declare to all the World, that without their aid and aſſiſtance, he ſhould not know after the Arch-Biſhop's Death, how to Govern the Dioceſs. It is furthermore ſaid, that <hi>Mar Abraham,</hi> when he was upon his Death-bed called the Rector of the College of <hi>Vaipicotta</hi> to him, and having all his Clergy about him, declared, that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Flock to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the chief Paſtor and Prelate of the whole Church, and Commanded the Arch-Deacon, and all his Prieſts,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61585:36"/> to obey the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> whom his <hi>Holineſs</hi> had ſent to cultivate that Vineyard in all things, and to be ſure to follow the Doctrines that they taught, which were the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; after which Charge he is ſaid further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to have beſeeched and conjured the Rector, by <hi>the love of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>great friendſhip</hi> there had been always between them, to take care of the Government of his Church after his Death, and to have ordered an authentick inſtrument to be made of all this to remain as a Teſtimony of his laſt Will, and of the Faith he died in.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Hiſtory furthermore tells us, That this Church was ſo far reconciled to the Pope, in the Year, 1596. that when the <hi>Jubile</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. was publiſhed among them by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> they gave his <hi>Holineſs</hi> a thouſand Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings for it, and took a ſingular pleaſure in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his Name; and that during the whole time of the <hi>Jubile,</hi> they were at Church from Morning to Night, without taking any refection, and were ſo zealous to confeſs themſelves to the Fathers, that they waited in the Church till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in great Crowds to do it. Now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this report of things, the Arch-Biſhop, when he came into the <hi>Serra,</hi> had little more to do than to open his Arms to embrace a People, who, being before hand prepared by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> were ready to throw themſelves into them.</p>
                  <p>But to leave Romance, and return to Hiſtory, having only obſerved by the way, that it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible from this groſs miſrepreſentation of thoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61585:37"/> Affairs, how little regard is to be had to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Reports of their Feats in the <hi>Indies;</hi> ſince to ſupport a Story purely invented for the Honour of their Order, they do not boggle to pretend to have an authentick inſtrument of the truth of it, and that drawn up by the Order of a dying Prelate.</p>
                  <p>But a thing happened at this time, which, tho' in it ſelf not conſiderable, did abundantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt how little diſpoſed the Clergy of this Church was to ſubmit to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Boy, that went to School to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> at <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> having been taught by them to name the Pope in his Prayers before the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> being over-heard doing it in the Church by ſome of the <hi>Malabar</hi> Prieſts, was, after they had beat him ſeverely, turned out of the Church; they ſpoke alſo to his Father to whip him out of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Pope, who, they ſaid, was none of their Prelate, nor had any thing to do with them. The Arch-Biſhop being informed thereof, writ immediately to the Arch Deacon, commanding him to make Examples of thoſe impudent He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, for what they had ſaid and done to the Boy: which the Arch-Deacon was ſo far from doing, that he Honoured them the more for it. By the way, the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> teaching their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to pray for the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> tho' after the Pope, is one inſtance, among others, of their Conſcience, in thoſe Parts, being ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their Policy.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61585:37"/>
                  <p>But the World continuing ſtill to blame the Arch-Biſhop for not putting the Affairs of the <hi>Serra</hi> into ſome other hands than thoſe of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> againſt whoſe order that whole Church was ſo much incenſed, he was obliged at laſt, tho' contrary to his Inclination, to ſend a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan</hi> Friar to the Arch-Deacon, with authority to take his Subſcription to the <hi>Roman</hi> Creed, and to require him to puniſh the Prieſts, who had beat the Boy for naming the Pope in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Deacon having nothing to object againſt the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friar, and being extreamly deſirous, if it was poſſible, to keep the Arch-Biſhop from coming into the <hi>Serra,</hi> tho' he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Subſcribe the Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to Subſcribe a Confeſſion of Faith, wherein he profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and that he believed <hi>as the Church believed,</hi> but without naming the <hi>Roman,</hi> or acknowledging the Pope as univerſal Paſtor of the Church; he is furthermore ſaid, upon the Arch-Biſhop's ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his diſſatisfaction at the ambiguous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion he had made, to have given his conſent publickly to that of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. being read to him in <hi>Portugueze,</hi> of which he did not underſtand a Syllable. But let that be as it will, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he continued ſtill to teach, that the Pope was the head of his own Church, but had nothing to do with that of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61585:38"/>
                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop not being able to brook ſuch things any longer, fix'd a day for his going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Serra,</hi> and when the Viceroy and the whole Clergy beg'd of him not to expoſe his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuch viſible danger, they could have no other anſwer from him but this, <hi>That his life was but too ſecure in this caſe, ſeeing he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver merited enough to entitle him to the Honour of being a Martyr.</hi> However, leſt his Humility might deceive him in paſſing a Judgment upon himſelf, he did not think fit to truſt too much to his want of Merits; and for that reaſon went attended with a good Guard, he had alſo a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to treat with all the Princes of <hi>Malabar,</hi> about Peace and War, and particularly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the <hi>Samorim</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Portugueze</hi> to take <hi>Cunahle,</hi> a Fortreſs lately poſſeſſed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Mahometan</hi> Pyrates, who did very much diſturb the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Trade upon that Coaſt. This Neſt of Pyrates, was firſt built by one <hi>Pate Marca,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> who having in a ſhort time enriched it ſtrangely with the Spoils of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes,</hi> both by Sea and Land, left it at his Death to his Nephew <hi>Mahomet Cunahle Marca.</hi> This <hi>Mahomet</hi> was Governour, or rather Prince of it at this time; and as he was nothing inferior to his Uncle in Courage or Conduct, ſo he had Fortified the place ſo as to make it abſolutely one of the ſtrongeſt Garriſons in the <hi>Indies,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he inſult the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> only, but the <hi>Malabars</hi> alſo, and particularly the <hi>Samorim,</hi> in whoſe Country <hi>Cunahle</hi> ſtood, and who had given
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61585:38"/> leave to his Uncle to fortifie that place, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to incommode the <hi>Portugueze.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Hiſtorians will have it, that he took this Affair of <hi>Cunahle</hi> only in the way to his Viſitation; yet by the courſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, one would be tempted to think, that it was what principally carried him to thoſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th. of <hi>December,</hi> 1598. the Arch-Biſhop Embarked upon a Gally Commanded by <hi>Don Alvaro de Menezes,</hi> and on the day of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> arrived at the Bar of <hi>Cunahle,</hi> where he joined the whole <hi>Portugueze</hi> Armada, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Viceroy's Brother, he was ſaluted with all the Guns and Muſick of the Fleet; and having called a Council of War, and heard the ſeveral Opinions of all the Captains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beſt way to take <hi>Cunahle,</hi> he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſolution they had come to thereon, to the Council of State at <hi>Goa;</hi> a moſt Apoſtolical begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Viſitation. After having put the Siege of <hi>Cunahle</hi> into a good Poſture, he departed with a good Convoy to <hi>Cananor,</hi> where he continued 16 days, and then ſailed to <hi>Cochim,</hi> where he was ſplendidly received by the Governour and the whole City, at the Stairs they had made on purpoſe for him to Land at.</p>
                  <p>Next day, when the Magiſtrates of the City came to Complement him at his Houſe, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with his deſign of reducing the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> before he returned to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61585:39"/> 
                     <hi>Goa,</hi> deſiring their aſſiſtance therein, which they frankly promiſed him.</p>
                  <p>The day following His <hi>Grace</hi> having called the common Council of the City together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the enterpriſe of <hi>Cunahle</hi> to them, whom he made ſo ſenſible of how great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it was to their City above all others, to have that Fortreſs wreſted out of the hands of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Pyrates, who had lately made themſelves Maſters of it, that they immediately cauſed 150 Men to be Raiſed and Armed at their own Charge, whom, together with a great quantity of all ſorts of Ammunition, they ſent upon five ſtout Ships to joyn the <hi>Armada</hi> before <hi>Cunahle;</hi> the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop alſo, to give the more life to the enterpriſe, ſent one of the beſt of his own <hi>Manchua's</hi> or Yachts, mann'd with his own menial Servants, along with them.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Cochim</hi> was much troubled to hear of the Arch-Biſhop's being ſo hot upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Cunahle,</hi> being ſenſible that a Peace betwixt the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> and the <hi>Samorim,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe aſſiſtance by Land, it wou'd be hard for them to reduce that Fortreſs, muſt be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the enterpriſe. And as there had been nothing, the Kings of <hi>Cochim</hi> had been always more careful to hinder ſuch a Peace, which they than did on purpoſe to keep the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> in a cloſer dependance upon them; ſo the preſent King fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the wiſe meaſures of his Anceſtors, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd, by a Stratagem, to deſtroy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he ſaw the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> had already repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61585:39"/> in the <hi>Samorim.</hi> To which end he ſent his <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> and one <hi>Joan de Miranda,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Cochim,</hi> to wait upon the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> and to acquaint his <hi>Grace</hi> from him, that he had received certain advice from ſome Spies he had in the <hi>Samorim</hi> Cabinet-Council, that that Prince, whenever the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> Landed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of joyning with them, had determined to cut them all off in revenge of the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they had done his Anceſtors, of which danger he thought himſelf obliged, both as a Friend and a Brother in Arms to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to adviſe him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> who underſtood the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of Princes, as well as any Man living, returned the King his Thanks for his Intelligence, but withal ſent him word, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to truſt the <hi>Samorim</hi> in this occaſion; and the rather, becauſe they did not want Power to be revenged on all that ſhould deceive the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> either in Peace or War.</p>
                  <p>The King, when he found his Plot had not ſucceeded according to his expectation, reſolved to divert the <hi>Samorim</hi> from ſending an Army to <hi>Cunahle,</hi> by making a War preſently upon the <hi>Caimal,</hi> or Prince of <hi>Corngeira</hi> his Friend and Allie: and having with incredible expedition got an Army of 60000 Men together, he ſent to let the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> know, that before he marched he deſigned to wait upon him. The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> tho' he did not go over his Threſhold to meet the King, received him, when he came,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61585:40"/> with great Civility; and after the Complements were over, acquainted him firſt, with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of viſiting all the <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> in the <hi>Serra,</hi> in order to reduce them to the true Chriſtian Faith, from which they had very much ſwerved; telling him, that ſince great numbers of thoſe Churches were within his Territories, he expected his aſſiſtance in ſo good a work; of which being aſſured by the King, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> went on and told him, that there was another thing that he muſt not deny him, and that was to put off his War with the <hi>Caimal</hi> till <hi>Cunahle</hi> was taken; the King gave many reaſons why he could not deferr it; but the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> preſt him ſo hard upon the point, that before they parted, he made him promiſe to disband his Army.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having put the Affairs of the Siege in a good poſture, begun to apply himſelf to the reduction of the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the firſt ſtep he made towards it, was to ſend to the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> to come and ſpeak with him at <hi>Cochim.</hi> But after having expected him ſome days, and finding that he neither came himſelf, nor returned him any anſwer, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as well he might, that he was afraid to venture himſelf in that City; whereupon he ſent him a Letter of <hi>ſafe Conduct,</hi> ſwearing he would not queſtion him about any thing that was paſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> upon this occaſion, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a great number of <hi>Caçanares,</hi> and other
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61585:40"/> conſiderable Chriſtians to conſult together what was beſt to be done. It was agreed on all hands, that the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> ſhou'd go and wait upon his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> who was a Perſon of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to be able to undo them all at once, by depriving them of their <hi>Pepper</hi>-Trade, if they ſhould diſoblige him, and beſides, he was able to oblige their Kings, who were all very much at his Devotion, to Sacrifice all their Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to his diſpleaſure; and what made them the willinger to comply with him therein, was, their being confident that they ſhould be quickly rid of his Company, ſince Winter was at hand, which they thought would certainly call him to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon all which Conſiderations it was agreed, That they ſhould give way to his ſaying of <hi>Maſs,</hi> and his Preaching in their Churches, which their Books told them was a common Civility, that is every where paid to Biſhops, tho' out of their own Dioceſſes; but as for any Acts of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as Viſiting, Conferring Orders, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and the like, if he ſhould pretend to exerciſe any ſuch Acts, as it was to be feared he would, that they ſhou'd then put him off as well as they cou'd with delays, until he returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> which they thought he would in two Months at fartheſt; by which means they might, without embroiling themſelves with ſo powerful a Prelate, wait till they had a Biſhop ſent them by the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to whom they had writ for one; of all which they made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61585:41"/> Inſtrument, and for their further Security, brought together a Body of 3000 brave Men, who were all well Armed; the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> being, by much, both the ſtouteſt and beſt Firemen in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> knew very well, which made them be the more zealous to reduce them to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in order to make them Subjects to the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſent alſo at the ſame time to ſome of their <hi>Paniquais,</hi> ſome of which have 4000, ſome 6000 Men at their Command, to come and ſpeak with him at <hi>Cochim;</hi> but they, inſtead of going thither, took an Oath ſolemnly to make themſelves <hi>Amouços,</hi> after the Cuſtom of the <hi>Malavars,</hi> againſt him, in caſe he offer'd any violence to their <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> or to any other of their Prieſts. When the <hi>Malavars</hi> devote themſelves to be <hi>Amouços</hi> for any cauſe, they defend it to the laſt drop of their Blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either fear or wit.</p>
                  <p>With two of theſe <hi>Paniquais,</hi> and 3000 Men well Armed, the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> came to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> at <hi>Cochim. Don Antonio de Noronha,</hi> the Governour of the City, met them without the Gates, and conducted them to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Palace. The <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> when he came before the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> kneeled down and kiſs'd his Hand, as did all the other <hi>Caçanares</hi> that were in his Company; the two <hi>Paniquais</hi> were alſo preſented to his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> by the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> who when the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> and the <hi>Governour,</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:61585:41"/> and the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> came to ſit down, placed themſelves at the Elbows of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Chair, where they ſtood all the while with their broad Swords naked over his Head. The door of the Room where they were being ſhut, to keep out the Crowd, thoſe that ſtood without imagining that it was done to make their <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> a Priſoner, ſaid to one another, this is the time to die for our <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> and for the Church of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but being aſſured that their <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> was in no danger, they were quieted.</p>
                  <p>After the hubbub was over, and they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed together for ſome time, it was agreed, that the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſhould go next day to <hi>Vaipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotta,</hi> which upon the account of its having a College of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in it, ſhould be the firſt Church he ſhould Viſit, and that the <hi>Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> with his <hi>Caçanares,</hi> ſhould repair thither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having furniſhed himſelf with all Neceſſaries for his Voyage, embarked with all his Retinue upon ſeven <hi>Tones</hi> or <hi>Gallies,</hi> and <hi>Roque de Mello Pereyro,</hi> who had been Governour of <hi>Malaca,</hi> attended him with two <hi>Gallies</hi> more, and <hi>Joan Pereyra de Miranda,</hi> who was afterwards Governour of <hi>Cranganor</hi> with one.</p>
                  <p>Being arrived at <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> he was conduct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and their Scholars, and the whole Village to the Church, where, with his <hi>Mitre</hi> on his Head, and his <hi>Croſier</hi> in his hand, he gave them a long Sermon. His Text was, <hi>He that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61585:42"/> entereth not in by the door,</hi> &amp;c. on which words he told them at length, <hi>That none were true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but what entered in by the door of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and were ſent by the Pope, who was Chriſt's Vicar; which none of their former Prelates having been, who had been all ſent to them by the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Biſhops of</hi> Babylon, <hi>they were all Thieves and Murderers of the Flock.</hi> When he had done his Sermon, he bid them come next day to the Church to be confirmed, which ſome did; to whom, after he had confirmed them, he told the news of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> a place moſt of them had never heard of before.</p>
                  <p>All this while no <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> appeared, who came not to <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> till two days after the arrival of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop.</hi> He had delayed his coming on purpoſe, that he might not by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſeem to conſent to any of thoſe things, which he knew the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> would offer to do at that place.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> knew well enough what it was that had made the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> loiter ſo behind, yet he diſſembled ſo far as to receive him very kindly, treating with him about the courſe he was to take in the reduction of the Church, who ſeemed to approve of every thing that was propoſed to him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> went daily to <hi>Matins</hi> and <hi>Veſpers,</hi> which were ſung by thoſe of the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> but coming to underſtand at laſt, for he underſtood <hi>Chaldee</hi> no more than he did <hi>Malavar,</hi> that they prayed therein for the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61585:42"/> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſtiling him the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Paſtor of the Church,</hi> a Title that all Patriarchs, as well as the Pope, have aſſumed to themſelves for ſome Hundred of Years (nay, by what <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> I. has ſaid of that Title, I do not know but the Pope might be one of the laſt that aſſumed it) he reſolved not to permit ſo wicked a thing to be done any longer, notwithſtanding all that the good <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who out of Policy had all along complyed with it, could ſay to diſſwade him; and ſo having one Evening, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his deſign to any one, called all the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> Maſters of the Seminary, and the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> and his <hi>Caçanares,</hi> together at his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, having firſt made a Speech to them to prove, <hi>That the</hi> Pope <hi>was the only Head of the Church on Earth, and that the Biſhop of</hi> Babylon <hi>was a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Schiſmatick,</hi> he pulled out of his Pocket an Excommunication <hi>latae ſententiae,</hi> commanding his Secretary to read it with an audible Voice, and his Interpreter to declare it to thoſe that did not underſtand <hi>Latin,</hi> in <hi>Malavar,</hi> by which he Commanded, <hi>That no Perſon Secular or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick do from henceforward preſume to pray for the</hi> Patriarch of Babylon. He Commanded the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> and <hi>Caçanares</hi> to ſign it, and finding the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> had a great mind to have ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled it off, he ſaid to him, <hi>Sign it, Father, for it is full time the Axe were laid to the Root of the Tree;</hi> to which the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> returned no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but Signed it without ſaying a word, as did all the other <hi>Caçanares,</hi> after which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61585:43"/> it was fixed to the Gates of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians of the Village, when they came to hear of what had been done, run, as if they had been Mad, in a Body to the <hi>Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>'s Lodgings, where, with one voice, they ſet up a moſt lamentable howl, crying out, <hi>That the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Goa, <hi>with his</hi> Portuguezes <hi>was come to deſtroy their Religion, and had affronted their</hi> Patriarch, <hi>by whom they had been Governed for above</hi> 1200 <hi>Years;</hi> and after having exclaimed againſt the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> at a moſt bitter rate, and bewailed their great Miſery, in having Strangers come among them to deſtroy the Religion they had been born and bred in, they told their <hi>Caſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares,</hi> that if they would but give way to it, they would either Sacrifice their Lives in defence of their Religion, or be revenged on thoſe that had affronted it.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> having made a ſign, that he deſired to be heard, they all held their Peace, he told them, <hi>There was a time for all things, and that that was not a time for Revenge, but Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; that it was true he had Signed the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, but that he did it purely out of Fear, for they were to conſider, that, beſides the Strength the</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>had brought along with him, he had engaged the King of</hi> Cochim, <hi>in whoſe Country they were, to protect him in all he did, and who, if they ſhould offer any affront to the</hi> Arch-Biſhop, <hi>would certainly revenge it on their Lives and Eſtates. As to himſelf, he was reſolved to die in defence of the Religion of his Country, ſooner than conſent to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61585:43"/> introduction of</hi> Popery; adding, <hi>The</hi> Portuguezes, <hi>if they liked their own Religion, might live in it, in God's Name, and he knew no Body that would trouble them for it; but that he ſaw no reaſon why they ſhould thus diſturb and perſecute People in their own Country, becauſe they will not turn</hi> Papiſts, <hi>or change their</hi> old Religion <hi>for theirs, and that as to the</hi> Arch-Biſhop, <hi>the thing that made him ſo furious to deſtroy the Authority of the</hi> Patriarch of Babylon <hi>was, that he might make himſelf Primate of the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; <hi>to which he hoped, none of the Chriſtians of</hi> Malabar <hi>would ever conſent, or would ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to forſake their</hi> old Religion <hi>for that of</hi> Popery. At this they all gave a great ſhout, crying, <hi>They would loſe their Lives, and all they had in the World, before they would do it.</hi> But none of the forementioned <hi>Amoucos</hi> being among them, it's like, at that time they went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portuguezes</hi> upon this uproar, did not forbear to blame the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> for having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſuch an <hi>Excommunication,</hi> contrary to the advice of all that were about him, adviſing him to haſten aboard his Galleys if he would ſecure his Perſon; he told them, <hi>He was ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting for what he had done, that were it to do again, he would do it, and that inſtead of retreating to</hi> Cochim, <hi>he would go next Morning to</hi> Paru.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paru</hi> is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a Kingdom, wherein the nobleſt Body of all the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> lives, but withal, the moſt violent againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> as they had ſufficiently manifeſted on ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61585:44"/> for tho' <hi>Don Jorge du Cruz,</hi> and <hi>Don Joan du Cruz,</hi> both Natives of the Country, had been ſent by the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. who had done them great Honours there, and had granted them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Indulgences</hi> for their Churches, and withal, a Privileged Altar therein, yet their Countrymen did not only ſlight all thoſe <hi>Indulgences,</hi> but would not ſo much as ſuffer them, tho' of two of the nobleſt Families in the Country, to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in any of their Churches, and at laſt forc'd them to leave the Kingdom, their own Brethren and Kinsfolk, having the firſt hand in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians of <hi>Paru,</hi> tho' thus affected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, had, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Agreement, prepared great <hi>Feſtivities</hi> for the reception of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> hoping, by ſuch Complements, to have kept him from doing any buſineſs; but, having the Night before he came, heard of what he had done at <hi>Vaipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotta</hi> to their Patriarch, they turned all their <hi>Feſtivities</hi> into <hi>Arms,</hi> and were ſo much incenſed againſt him, that when he Landed, he was met by eight or ten Perſons only that waited on the <hi>Arch-Deacon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> tho' he read trouble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in all their Countenances, ſeemed to take no notice of it, but with his <hi>Croſs</hi> carried before him went directly to the Church, which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Cuſtom, he found full of Armed Men, without ſo much as one Woman or Child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61585:44"/> them; whereupon, being apprehenſive leſt his Guards and Servants, if they continued aſhoar, might come to Blows with the <hi>Malavars,</hi> whom he ſaw ſo much diſpoſed to Quarrel, he Commanded them all aboard except two Prieſts, who were to aſſiſt at the Offices.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having put on his <hi>Pontificals,</hi> and given his Bleſſing to the Congregation, made a long diſcourſe to them, ſhewing them, <hi>That there was but one true Religion, which was the</hi> Roman, <hi>and that all Chriſtians were under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable obligation to ſubmit themſelves to the</hi> Pope. After he had done his Sermon, which laſted an hour and an half, and explained to them the Doctrine of the Sacrament of <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and then called upon them to come to it; the Congregation, tho' they had heard him till then very quietly; began to cry out with great fury, <hi>That they would never be Confirmed by him, that being a thing that none of their Prelates had ever uſed, and that it was no Sacrament of Chriſt's Inſtitution, but an Invention of the</hi> Portuguezes <hi>to make them their Slaves, by</hi> ſetting a Mark on their Foreheads, <hi>and</hi> giving them a Box on the Ear, which is what all the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops do in <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and tho' the</hi> Daſtards <hi>in</hi> Vaipicotta <hi>had been ſo tame as to ſuffer themſelves to be buffeted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved by him, they would never endure it, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to touch their Beards, or their Wives Faces; that he might go home in a good hour to his</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes, <hi>and let them alone with their Religion, and if he did continue to diſturb them thus, it ſhould
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61585:45"/> coſt him dear.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> heard all this with great patience, and ſitting down, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to convince them of the Truth of the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation;</hi> but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they were the worſe, rather than the better for what he ſaid to them, having mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered all his Courage together, he roſe up, and having advanced two ſteps with his <hi>Croſier</hi> in his hand, he told them with great heat, <hi>That the Faith he Preached to them was the Faith of</hi> Chriſt <hi>and St.</hi> Thomas, <hi>and was believed by all Chriſtians, and that he was ready to die to confirm the truth of it;</hi> but they being as ready to die for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as he was, or pretended to be, for his, that Argument had no effect at all upon them. He furthermore challenged all thoſe that <hi>Talked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith by Night in Corners, to come forth, if they durſt, to diſpute with him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly;</hi> which the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> who the Night before had aſſembled moſt of the conſiderable Chriſtians of <hi>Paru</hi> together, and had made them promiſe never to throw off the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> taking to himſelf, he roſe up in, a paſſion, and having asked aloud <hi>who they were that taught Hereſies in the dark, and that Preached no where but in Corners,</hi> flung out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and going into the Town picked up eight or ten Boys, whom he preſented to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> to be confirmed by him, pretending, that with all that he was able to do, he could perſwade no more to come: The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having confirmed theſe Boys, returned to his Gallies very angry,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61585:45"/> and finding there was nothing more to be done at <hi>Paru,</hi> he determined to Sail next Morning to <hi>Mangate,</hi> to ſee how thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>When he came to the Church of <hi>Mangate,</hi> a Town chiefly inhabited by Chriſtians, he found the Church filled with Houſhold Goods and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by reaſon of the War that was then on foot between the Kings of <hi>Mangate</hi> and <hi>Paru.</hi> After having comforted the Chriſtians for the Loſſes they had ſuſtained, and given them his Bleſſing, he began to Preach againſt the Errors they had been Educated in. But having advice that there were ſome <hi>Amouços</hi> coming after him from <hi>Paru,</hi> he went ſtraightways aboard his Gallies, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away before Night, he arrived next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Cheguree,</hi> a place belonging to his Friend the King of <hi>Cochim;</hi> where having ſent aſhore an Order to the <hi>Caçanares</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to meet him at the Church, he had word ſent him, that the Church doors were all ſhut, and there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, Woman, nor Child, to be ſeen in the whole Village; he was informed at Night, that the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> was in the Town, but that he had ſhut himſelf up in a Houſe, and was reſolved never to ſee his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portuguezes</hi> that were in his Train, as well Eccleſiaſticks as Seculars, were at him perpetually to give over this enterpriſe, and not to expoſe his Perſon and Dignity (as he did) to no purpoſe; but inſtead of returning any anſwer to their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61585:46"/> Importunities, he retired all alone to his <hi>Cabin,</hi> where he wrote a long Letter to the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> in which he ſwore that he remembred nothing that was paſt, and that he had no deſign of doing him any harm, and if he would but do him the favour to come and ſpeak with him once more, he did not doubt but that he ſhould be able to convince him of his Errors, promiſing with all to do great things for him, if he would but entirely ſubmit himſelf to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>This Letter was delivered the ſame Night to the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> who having read it, called the <hi>Caçanares</hi> together, and told them, that it being a ſcandalous thing in them to decline treating with the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> above board, about the Affairs of Religion, he was for their going to wait upon him to hear what he could ſay, but with ſuch a Guard, that it ſhould not be in his Power to make them Priſoners.

They told him <hi>they did, and would die rather than deny any thing that was revealed in it. Well then,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Arch-Biſhop, pray tell me, how you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile what St.</hi> John <hi>ſaith,</hi> The word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us, <hi>with what your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Biſhops have taught you, to wit,</hi> that the Word did not make it ſelf Fleſh, and that Chriſt was not God, and that God did not make himſelf Man, <hi>for do you not ſing in your Churches upon the Feaſt of the Nativity, that the Word did not make it ſelf Fleſh, as the unbelieving</hi> Romans <hi>teach, but did only dwell in Chriſt as in a Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> returned no anſwer to this, but paſſing to another point, ſaid to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop, Your</hi> Grace <hi>would fain perſwade us likewiſe, that none can be ſaved out of the Obedience of the</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61585:47"/> Roman <hi>Church, which is what St.</hi> John <hi>no where ſaith, that ever I could ſee; beſides, we have in our</hi> Archives <hi>a Letter of St.</hi> Caius, <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein he confeſſeth that he had nothing to do with the Church of</hi> Babylon, <hi>no more than the Church of</hi> Babylon <hi>had to do with his Church. We have alſo another Letter, which is called in our Books the</hi> Letter of the Lord's-day, <hi>becauſe it is ſaid upon that day to have fallen down from Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame Truth is affirmed.</hi> Here the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> run into a long diſcourſe of the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s being his Succeſſor, and <hi>Chriſt's Vicar</hi> upon Earth; after which they came at laſt to this Agreement, That as to matters of Faith, a Synod ſhould be called to determine them; and that in the mean while the <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> might, if he pleaſed, give the Bleſſing, and Preach in any of their Churches, but ſhould not be received in them as their Prelate, but as a Biſhop that was a Stranger, neither ſhould he pretend to <hi>Confirm,</hi> or do any other Epiſcopal Act within that Dioceſs. This Agreement was Signed by the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> and all the <hi>Caçanares</hi> who were preſent, with a Declaration that the Synod ſhould be Celebrated before <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> and that the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> ſhould no longer ſtir up the People againſt him, nor go attended with ſuch Troops of Armed Men as he had done formerly.</p>
                  <p>This Agreement being Signed, the <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> ſet Sail for <hi>Canhur,</hi> whither the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> went by Land, not daring to truſt himſelf by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61585:47"/> Water, where he would have been in the Power of the <hi>Portuguezes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Canhur</hi> he was received very friendly by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who had been told by the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> that he did not pretend to come among them as their Prelate, but only as a Stranger, but tho' he kept to his Agreement ſo far as not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to do any thing but give the Bleſſing and Preach, yet in his <hi>Sermon,</hi> which was a very long one, he talked ſo much of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and its <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and of the obligation all Churches were under to ſubmit to it, that the whole Congregation were much offended with him; the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> was likewiſe diſcontented with it, and being Sick, or at leaſt pretending he was, returned to <hi>Cheguree</hi> to be cured; and the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having other work on his hands, was willing enough to diſmiſs him; who, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Inſtruction he brought with him from <hi>Goa,</hi> was obliged to haſten to <hi>Coulaon,</hi> a Fortreſs belonging to the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> to ſee in what condition it was, and to take ſome courſe to have the Fort the King of <hi>Travancor</hi> was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Neighbourhood, and would much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode it, demoliſhed.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt of <hi>March</hi> he ſet Sail for a Caſtle that is within two Leagues of <hi>Cochim,</hi> where the Governour and Biſhop of the City met him, to whom having communicated his Deſigns, he Sailed directly for <hi>Porcoa,</hi> where the King of the Country had been ſome days expecting him; he went to a Church that was there in the Evening,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61585:48"/> where he was kindly received by the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> the King, who profeſſed a great Friendſhip for the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> having Commanded them, upon pain of his diſpleaſure, to comply with the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in all things. After having Preached, he went to Lodge at the Houſe of the <hi>Caçanar,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King came at Night to viſit him; the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> entertained him very friendly, and thanked him for the kindneſs he had ſhewed to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and their Churches, and for having cleared his Coaſt of Pyrates: the King, after ſome Complements deſired to be admitted to the Honour of being a <hi>Brother in Arms</hi> to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as the King of <hi>Cochim</hi> had been: The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> told him, that was an Honour the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> never did to any King, before he had merited it by ſome ſignal Service; however, he promiſed to do all that lay in his Power to help him to it.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning the <hi>Arch-Biſhap</hi> went to Church, where he ſaid <hi>Maſs,</hi> and afterwards confirmed the whole Congregation, notwithſtanding his late ſolemn Promiſe to the contrary, as indeed none but Fools will ever expect, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any ſuch Promiſes longer than the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity they have to break them.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Porcoa</hi> he ſailed directly to <hi>Coulaon,</hi> where, under pretence of viſiting a Church that ſtood near the Fort the King of <hi>Travancor</hi> was building, he took a view of the Fort, and finding it was near finiſhed, and would in a few days have a Garriſon put in it, he immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61585:48"/> away a Meſſenger to the Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Fleet and Troops that were before <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahle,</hi> to come forthwith with his whole <hi>Armada</hi> to demoliſh the ſaid Fort, which, if he came quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he might do with great eaſe, for that he would find none in it but Workmen.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt know that the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> when he was laſt at the Bar of <hi>Cunahle,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the King of <hi>Travancor</hi> and the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes</hi> were at that time in Peace, had left a private Order with the General, that ſo ſoon as he was Maſter of <hi>Cunahle,</hi> he ſhould ſet Sail im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with the whole <hi>Armada,</hi> and demoliſh this Fort, which, by reaſon of <hi>Cunahle</hi>'s not being yet taken, had not been executed.</p>
                  <p>But while the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was expecting the Captain-General, he received the bad news of a great ſlaughter of <hi>Portuguezes</hi> in an Attack they had made upon <hi>Cunahle,</hi> and that the Captain-General was retired to <hi>Cochim</hi> to have his wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men cured; from whence he intended to come and wait upon him for further Orders.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was extreamly troubled at this News, as well upon the account of the great numbers of Perſons of Quality that had been killed in the Action, as becauſe he feared it would very much hearten the Kings of <hi>Malabar,</hi> who had till then ſtill looked upon the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> as Invincible. Wherefore, to prevent the ill effects that the true News of this Defeat might have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Minds of the Princes of <hi>Malabar,</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Letters immediately to all of them to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61585:49"/> acquaint them with the great Victory the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> had obtained before <hi>Cunahle;</hi> and tho' he acknowledged, that it was purchaſed with the Blood of ſeveral brave Men, among whom were ſome of his own Kindred, who were very dear to him, yet he did not doubt but that they would infallibly carry the Place, at the next Attack they made.</p>
                  <p>Theſe tricks of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> coming ſo thick, one upon the neck of another, for here we have no fewer than three of them in leſs than a Fortnight, puts me in mind of what <hi>Manuel de Faria</hi> ſaith of him in the <hi>3d.</hi> Tome of his <hi>Aſia Portugueſa,</hi> which I ſhall give the Reader in his own words, <q rend="margDblQuotes">Eſte illuſtre Prelado eſtuviera yo por ventura en el numero de los ſantos, ſi no paſſara a Eſpanna a donde le quito eſta gloria, en la opinion mortal, la deficil del acierto en el maneio de los grandes pueſtos que vinoa ocupar, o fueſſen ſolicitudos, o fueſſen ofrecidos.</q> 
                     <q rend="italic">This Illuſtrious Prelate, had he never returned to <hi>Spain,</hi> had, in all probability, been made a Saint before this time, where, thro' the difficulty there is in the managery of high Poſts, whether offered to him or procured by Sollicitations, he loſt all the Glory he had acquired in the <hi>Indies</hi> in the Opinion of the World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His High Poſts in <hi>Spain,</hi> which the Author ſaith he does not know whether he procured by Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations or not, were the <hi>Primacy of Braga,</hi> and <hi>Viceroyſhip of Portugal,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> III. for two Years, and the <hi>Preſidentſhip</hi> of the <hi>Council of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61585:49"/> State</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in which Office and Court he died.</p>
                  <p>What his Miſcarriages were in <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby he is ſaid to have forfeited his Glory, I have not been able to learn; but whatever they were, one would think that the violating of a ſolemn Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment openly, within a Week after it was made, and the ordering a Fort belonging to a Prince, that was in Peace with them, to be treacherouſly demoliſhed, and the diſperſing of notorious Falſhoods only to ſerve a turn, ought to be no very good title to <hi>Saintſhip.</hi> But the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> if he could have had hands to have executed it, had ſerved the King of <hi>Travancor</hi> a much worſe trick than this, when he was upon his Viſitation that was after the Synod. We are told of a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing ſpoke by a <hi>Portugueze</hi> Captain, that was very brave, but had ſcarce Bread to eat, who, in this Siege, having ſeven of his Teeth ſtruck out with a Muſquet-Bullet, after he had wiped his Mouth ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Mahometan <hi>had done him no Injury, and had known doubtleſs he had no need of Teeth.</hi> But to return to the Story.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> after having ſent this falſe News about, and having ſent to the Queen of <hi>Changanate,</hi> to let her know, that he ſhould not be able to meet her according to his Promiſe, until he returned; Sailed in great haſt to <hi>Cochim,</hi> to conferr with the Captain-General, and to conſult whether it would not be convenient to make an abſolute Peace with the <hi>Samorim,</hi> and the rather becauſe he had been ſo true to his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61585:50"/> Word, in carrying on the Siege of <hi>Cunahle.</hi> It was agreed on all hands that ſuch a Peace would be convenient at that time; however, they would not venture to conclude it before they had the <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Opinion of it, to whom they ſent the Project.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> after he had diſpatched this buſineſs, Sailed to <hi>Molandurte,</hi> a great place of Chriſtians, where he was received very kindly, which kindneſs of theirs is ſaid to have coſt them dear; for the King of <hi>Cochim,</hi> to whom <hi>Molandurte</hi> belongs, being grown extreamly jealous that the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> under a pretence of reducing the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> deſigned to bring them under the obedience of the Crown of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> as it is plain he did from the 24th <hi>Decree</hi> of the laſt <hi>Action</hi> of the following <hi>Synod,</hi> for this very reaſon laid a great Tribute upon them, which they have not been able to this day to ſhake off; and furthermore Commanded them, upon pain of Death, to repair to <hi>Angamale</hi> to their <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> who being there, and having heard, it's like, of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s having vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their Agreement within leſs than a Week after it was made, begun to thunder out Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications againſt him, writing to all his Churches to have nothing more to do with him, and to all the Princes of <hi>Malabar,</hi> to have a care of him as a Perſon that had ill deſigns upon their Subjects.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61585:50"/>
                  <p>While the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was at <hi>Molandurte,</hi> where he confirmed and exerciſed all Epiſcopal Acts, he received Letters from the <hi>Viceroy</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his Project of Peace with the <hi>Samorim,</hi> and deſiring him to return to <hi>Vaipim</hi> to Sign it, which he did in great haſte, as did the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Biſhop of <hi>Cochim</hi> alſo, who both met him there.</p>
                  <p>This Peace was much promoted on the <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> ſide by his Nephew and firſt Miniſter <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niare Cherare,</hi> who, notwithſtanding he had been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Chriſtned by Father <hi>Roz,</hi> had leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to Profeſs himſelf a Heathen ſtill, the better to enable him to ſerve the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> which he did effectually, both by communicating to them daily all the Secrets of his Uncles Cabinet-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, whereof he was Preſident, and by diſpoſing him to have a good opinion of the <hi>Portuguezes;</hi> which was what he would not have been in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to have done, but would have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſgraced, and turned out of all, had he diſcovered himſelf to have been a Chriſtian ſo ſoon as he was Baptized. And as for the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> we find he was ſo far from condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the Prince or the Jeſuite for this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous diſſimulation, that after the Celebration of the Synod he confirmed and anointed the Prince therein, by giving him the Sacrament of <hi>Chriſm</hi> or <hi>Confirmation,</hi> with the ſame Secreſie, and the ſame Diſpenſation as the Jeſuite had given him that of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61585:51"/>
                  <p>After he had diſpatched the Peace, Signed to the Captain-General, he ſet Sail for <hi>Diamper,</hi> the ancient Seat of ſeveral of the Biſhops of the <hi>Serra,</hi> where meeting with ſeveral that had a mind to take Orders, there having been no Ordination in the Biſhoprick for two Years, he gave notice that he intended to conferr Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the <hi>Saturday</hi> before the <hi>Fifth Sunday</hi> in <hi>Lent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He writ alſo to the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> to come and aſſiſt at the Solemnity; the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> was much concerned at the news, and writ him back word, <hi>That this was contrary to the late A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement they had made together, and that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it would put an end to the Affair of the Synod, which he ſeemed to deſire ſo much, ſince the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point that was to be debated therein was, <hi>Whether he was their Prelate or no?</hi>
                     </hi> But the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> fanſying that the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> talked of a Synod only to amuſe him and gain time, writ him word, that nothing ſhould hinder him from Conferring Orders at the time appointed; and not only ſo, but that he would exerciſe all other Acts of Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, in obedience to the Pope's <hi>Briefs,</hi> to whom all the Churches of the World were ſubject. The <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> finding he was abſolutely determined to Ordain, deſired him, ſince he was reſolved to do't right or wrong, to Ordain none but <hi>Latins,</hi> for ſo they called not only the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> but all the <hi>Malavars,</hi> who were bred up under the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſent him word again, that he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61585:51"/> would Ordain both <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his buſineſs to deſtroy that diſtinction by bringing all Chriſtians under one head. Upon this the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> finding nothing elſe would do, ordered an Edict to be publiſhed in all the Churches of the Dioceſs, prohibiting all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, upon pain of Excommunication, <hi>latae ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> to receive any Orders from him, with which he ſent another Inſtrument, commanding all Prieſts and Chriſtian People not to ſuffer him to come into any of their Churches, as alſo not to be preſent at any of his <hi>Maſſes</hi> or <hi>Sermons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> had Preached two days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and had confirmed a great many before theſe Inſtruments had reached <hi>Diamper;</hi> but after they came once to be publiſhed, they put a full ſtop to what went on ſo currently before: The oldeſt <hi>Caçanar</hi> of the Church requiring the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> upon the receipt of them, to leave the place, and not to offer to ſet his Foot in their Church any more, nor to Confirm any Body, which among them, who anointed Children on the Head when they were Baptized, was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> continued ſtill a Preaching, and when the day appointed for the Ordination was come, Ordained 37 on it, having firſt obliged them to ſubſcribe the Faith of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. and to ſwear obedience to the Pope. After this Solemnity was over, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> determined to paſs the <hi>Holy Week,</hi> and <hi>Eaſter</hi> at <hi>Carturte,</hi> a conſiderable Town of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61585:52"/> 
                     <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Dominions of the Queen of <hi>Pimenta.</hi> He took ſeveral Churches in his way thither, at ſome of which he met with a kind Reception, at others the Chriſtians would not ſo much as ſee him. Being arrived at <hi>Carturte,</hi> after a dangerous Voyage, on the <hi>Friday</hi> before <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> he went to Church betimes next Morning, where having ſaid <hi>Maſs,</hi> and Preached, he Commanded the Congregation not to fail to be at Church next day, for that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Importance to communicate to them; and having the ſame Night invited ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable Chriſtians of the place aboard his Galley, by ſome means or other; for you muſt underſtand he was not ſparing of his Money in this occaſion, no more than he was of his Promiſes, he gained two of the moſt ſubſtantial among them intirely to his Party, who did him afterwards very great Service: Their Names were <hi>Itimato Mapula,</hi> and <hi>Itimane Mapula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> not knowing but that the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes</hi> Muſick might charm the common People, and reconcile them to the <hi>Latin</hi> Service, to which they ſeemed to have a great averſion, ſent for a full Quire from <hi>Cochim,</hi> and on <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> had high <hi>Maſs</hi> performed with the ſame Ceremony and Majeſty that he could have had it done at <hi>Goa:</hi> but the <hi>Caçanares</hi> and People were ſo far from being ſatisfied with the Muſick and pompous Ceremony of that Service, that if they liked it ill before, they liked it a great deal worſe after that, as in truth none but they that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61585:52"/> place all Religion in external Performances can do otherwiſe, there being no Paſſion which that Service will not excite in its Spectators (which is all the People are) ſooner than Devotion.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of <hi>Pimenta</hi> being importun'd to it by ſeveral Chriſtians, and her own Jealouſies, ſent an Order to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> to leave her Kingdom in three days upon pain of Death, and not to trouble her Subjects with his <hi>Novelties,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, ſhe had reaſon to apprehend ſome ill deſign againſt her State was couched. But the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> knew his own ſtrength too well to be frighted away with Paper Threats, and ſo ſent the Queen back word poſitively, that he would not ſtir out of her Territories before he had finiſhed the work that had brought him thither, telling her withal, <hi>That he was ſerving her rather than otherwiſe in what he was doing, and that her</hi> Anceſtors <hi>had granted Privileges to the Arch-Biſhop of the</hi> Serra, <hi>but being</hi> Infidels <hi>had never offered to concern themſelves in the matters of their Religion; That if ſhe ſhould Murther him, ſhe muſt know, that ſhe Muthered the ſecond Man in the</hi> Indies; <hi>and that his would be the deareſt Blood that ever ſhe ſpilt in her Life; ſince the</hi> Portuguezes, <hi>the Greatneſs of whoſe Power ſhe and her Kingdom could not be but ſenſible of, having ſo often felt it, would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly Revenge his Death to the utmoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What made the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> the ſtouter in this occaſion, was his knowing that he had ſecured moſt of her <hi>Regedores,</hi> namely him of <hi>Carturte,</hi> and the Country about it to his Party, whom
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61585:53"/> he had engaged by very rich Preſents to favour and protect him in the execution of his deſigns. The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having thus intimidated the Queen, and bribed her Officers, began to make bolder ſteps than he had offered to make before, and ſo ſeeing a <hi>Caçanar</hi> at Church one day, whom he had excommunicated but a little before, for having preſumed to excommunicate him, he ſent to him to get him out of the Church, which was no place for an excommunicate Rebel as he was. The <hi>Caçanar</hi> laughed at the Order, and told him very briskly, <hi>That he would not go out of the Church, for that he was none of his Prelate, neither did he value</hi> Roman <hi>Excommunications no more than he did the dirt under his feet; the</hi> Roman <hi>Church having nothing to do with the Church of the</hi> Serra; the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> not being able to bear ſuch a publick Affront, and knowing his Party in the Church to be the ſtronger, commanded the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Muſick to ceaſe; and turning towards the place where the <hi>Caçanar</hi> ſtood, commanded him to come up to him, which the <hi>Caçanar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to do with great ſcorn; he was dragg'd up to him by ſome <hi>Caçanares,</hi> and others that he had gained to his Party, and being kept down upon his Knees before him, was commanded to beg his <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Pardon; he told them reſolutely, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> perceiving that he was not to be ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rified into a compliance, ordered him to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Night following ſeveral <hi>Caçanares</hi> and others, abjured the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Lodgings, which were over the Church. After which the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved either to make the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> bend, or to break with him totally; and ſo having all his Converts together, without whoſe adviſe he told them he would never do any thing; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them that he could no longer bear with the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi>'s Rebellion, and was therefore determined to depoſe him, and put another in his place, naming one <hi>Thomas Curia</hi> a near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi>'s, to be his Succeſſor. They all owned that His <hi>Grace</hi> had great reaſon to be angry with the <hi>Arch-Deacon;</hi> but yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was but a young Man, and had had the ill luck to be in the hands of bad Counſellors, they intreated His <hi>Grace,</hi> before he declared his place void, to allow them ſome time to admoniſh him in, and to try whether they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to Conformity; for which they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but twenty days, promiſing, that if he did not ſubmit within the time, that they would never own him more, but would ſubmit to any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61585:54"/> 
                     <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> that His <hi>Grace</hi> ſhould ſet over them. Next day they ſent ſix to treat with him, who, tho' they took a great deal of pains to perſwade him to ſubmit himſelf to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> could not prevail with him to do it.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Eaſter-Eve</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> had a ſecond Ordination, whereat he Ordained a great many that had been hindred by the <hi>Regedores</hi> from coming to the firſt. The ſame day <hi>Franciſco Roz,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who was afterwards made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the <hi>Serra</hi> by the Pope, came to wait upon the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> who, after <hi>Maſs,</hi> told him, <hi>That he could not believe he was in</hi> Carturte, <hi>where, not many Months ago, having a mind to ſay</hi> Maſs, <hi>he was forced to have the Church doors opened to him by the Queen's</hi> Regedor, <hi>and where, when he eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sacrament, the People all ſhut their Eyes, that they might not ſee it; and beat one of his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for having named the</hi> Pope <hi>in his Prayer's; and when he ſhewed them an Image of our</hi> Lady, <hi>cried out, <hi>Away with that filthineſs, we are Chriſtians, and for that reaſon do not adore Idols or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> intended to have a moſt ſolemn <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> which the <hi>Heathens</hi> having notice of, were reſolved either to hinder or diſturb it; but finding they were not ſtrong enough to do the former, by reaſon of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedore</hi>'s guarding the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> as he did, they hired the moſt infamous Sorcerer of the whole Country to kill the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> which he undertook to do with a Charm that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61585:54"/> had never failed him, but as he begun to do his <hi>Tricks</hi> in the <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> he was ſeized on and ſent to Priſon, and a Currier was immediately diſpatched away to the Queen to acquaint her with what had been done: The Queen ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſent back an Order, that he ſhould be put on the <hi>Caloete,</hi> which is a ſharp Stake faſtned in the Ground, which being ſtuck thorow the Body of the Malefactor, he dies thereon in great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> would not give way to his being puniſhed ſo, but condemned him to greater puniſhment, in ſending him to <hi>Cochim</hi> to Row in the Gallies as long as he lived, which ſhews how great the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Power, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came by it, was at <hi>Carturte,</hi> where he made his firſt great Converſion.</p>
                  <p>When the Morning-Service was over, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was invited by the <hi>Caçanares</hi> to the <hi>Nercha,</hi> which is a Feaſt kept in the Church on certain days, all the Chriſtians that are preſent ſitting down to it. The Biſhop, if preſent, craves the Bleſſing, and in his abſence, the eldeſt Prieſt of the Church. The Biſhop has one half of the Proviſion, the Prieſts a quarter, and the People a quarter among them. In many Churches there are certain Rents dedicated to the maintenance of thoſe Feaſts, which ſeem to be the ſame with the Apoſtolical <hi>Agapae</hi> or <hi>Love-Feaſts,</hi> I do not know but St. <hi>Paul</hi> might allude to this double Portion that the Biſhop has at theſe Feaſts, when he ſaith, <hi>That they who rule well, and labour in the Word and Doctrine, are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61585:55"/> worthy of double Honour;</hi> and the rather becauſe he immediately ſubjoyns, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides it is evident from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> 34 <hi>Ep.</hi> to his Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that the Clergy were ſaid to be Honoured, according to the proportion they had of the Publick Offerings where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Cellerinus,</hi> two Confeſſors, he writes, <hi>Presbyterii honorem deſignaſſe nos illis jam ſciatis, &amp; ſportulis iiſdem cum Presbyteris honorentur, &amp; diviſiones menſurnas aequatis quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus partiuntur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> being tired with the Service of the day, deſired to be excuſed aſſiſting at the <hi>Nercha;</hi> nevertheleſs he had his double Portion ſent home. It was a great branch of <hi>Figs,</hi> and ſeveral Cakes made of <hi>Rice</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> with ſeveral other Diſhes dreſſed <hi>a la Mode de Malabar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Evening the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> went and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited all the Sick in the Town, and gave them both Money and Ghoſtly Counſel, the People imagining that this was the common Practice of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates, began to cry them up to the Skies, as much more humble and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Eaſter-Tueſday</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> went out to <hi>Nagpili,</hi> a Church about a quarter of a League from <hi>Carturte,</hi> where having Preached, he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a great many, and reconciled ſeveral <hi>Caça<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. By the way, it is ſomething ſtrange too, how the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> tho' he was able to School their Kings and <hi>Regedores,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61585:55"/> who all ſpoke <hi>Portugueze,</hi> ſhould be ſo powerful a Preacher as the <hi>Portugueze</hi> make him to have been among the <hi>Malavars,</hi> conſidering that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew a word of their Language, nor they of his.</p>
                  <p>Next day the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſet Sail for <hi>Molan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durte,</hi> where, when he arrived, he found the People much changed from what they were, when he was there laſt, for they had ſhut the Church doors againſt him, neither did there ſo much as one ſingle Perſon appear to receive him at the place where he was to Land, which was a quarter of a League from the Town.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> underſtanding how things were aſhoar, did not offer to Land for fear of raiſing a Tumult, but wrote away immediately to the Governour of <hi>Cochim,</hi> to ſend the King of <hi>Cochim</hi>'s chief <hi>Regedor</hi> to him before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landurte.</hi> The King, tho' he did not love to hear of the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> being very ſenſible, if they were once brought under <hi>Portugueze</hi> Biſhops, it would not be long before they would be entirely under the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> too, by which means he ſhould loſe 50000 of the beſt Soldiers in his Kingdom; yet at the ſame time he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very zealous to promote that work, having more than once Commanded all his Chriſtian Subjects in all things to do what the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> would have them, and accordingly when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſent him word that the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak with the chief <hi>Regedor</hi> at <hi>Molandurte,</hi> he immediately ordered him to go and wait on him.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61585:56"/>
                  <p>When the <hi>Regedor</hi> was come, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> complained to him of the vexation his Maſter had given the Chriſtians of <hi>Molandurte,</hi> for no other reaſon but for the kind reception they had given him when he was there laſt. The <hi>Regedor</hi> endeavoured to palliate the matter, and promiſed to acquaint his Maſter with what the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> had told him, <hi>Who, if any thing were amiſs,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>would be ſure to redreſs it, and to give his</hi> Grace <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> here took him up ſhort, and told him, <hi>That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no kindneſs from his Maſter, ſince he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him ſo ſmall a favour, as to order the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets that were lodged in the Quire of the Church, to be removed to a proper place, which, tho' he had faithfully promiſed to do, yet he underſtood the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets were there ſtill.</hi> The <hi>Regedor</hi> told him, <hi>The</hi> Regedor <hi>of the Place, and not his Maſter, was to blame for that, who, to his knowledge, was ordered to have done it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Regedor</hi> went to Church together, where the <hi>Regedor,</hi> in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, commanded all the Chriſtians of the place, in the King's Name, to do whatſoever the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſhould command them. But, tho' he is ſaid, at the ſame time to have whiſpered ſome in the Ear, That the King would rather that they ſhould adhere to their <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> and their old Cuſtoms, than ſubmit to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> yet that did not appear in the ſudden change that was wrought in their Carriage, by what the <hi>Regedor</hi> had told them publickly; for they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61585:56"/> who but the day before would not ſo much as endure to ſee the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> were, without any other Argument, reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and him the next day.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Molandurte</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> went a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to <hi>Diamper,</hi> where the chief <hi>Regedor,</hi> according to his promiſe, met him again. The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> complained to him of the <hi>Regedor</hi> of the place, who had not only hindred the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from coming at him, but encouraged ſeveral <hi>Heathens</hi> to deride and threaten him; as the chief <hi>Regedor</hi> was offering to excuſe his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> interrupted him, and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cane</hi> he had in his hand three times againſt the Ground, bid him in a great fury not <hi>to offer to ſpeak to him, for that he knew his Heart well enough, and that he bore an ill will to all Chriſtians; but there's another,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I blame more than you, and that's your Maſter, who, notwithſtanding his being Brother in Arms to the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>ſuffers me to be abuſed in his Country; but you may tell your Maſter from me, that the King of</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <hi>ſhall know how I have been uſed by him, and that it will not be long before he ſhall ſmart for it.</hi> The <hi>Regedor</hi> deſiring to appeaſe him, did aſſure his <hi>Grace, That his Maſter knew nothing of what had been done to him at</hi> Diamper; <hi>and that ſo ſoon as he was acquainted with it, he would be ſure to make Examples of all thoſe that had any way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted his</hi> Grace. This put the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in a greater Paſſion than he was in before; he ſaid, <hi>This was all Trick, and that he had treated too

                  <p>The <hi>Regedor</hi> aſſured him a ſecond time, that his Maſter always had, and always would favour his deſigns in the <hi>Serra, I ſhall quickly know that,</hi> ſaid the Arch-Biſhop, <hi>for if you be ſincere, you will preſently call all the Chriſtians together, and Command them, in the King's Name to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me as their Prelate, and to unite themſelves to the Church of</hi> Rome. The <hi>Regedor</hi> promiſed to do it preſently, and having called all the Chriſtians together, commanded them before the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> on pain of the King's high diſpleaſure, to obey the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in all things, aſſuring them withal, that this was His Majeſty's Will, and therefore they ſhould give no credit to any that ſhould whiſper the contrary to them; and thus, by Hectoring and Bribing of Kings and their <hi>Regedores,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> made both ſudden and great Converſions.</p>
                  <p>Having diſmiſſed the <hi>Regedor,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> gave them a Sermon, and commanded them to come to Church next Morning to be confirmed by him. Next day after the Confirmation, he told them, <hi>That he had Excommunicated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the</hi> Arch-Deacon, <hi>as a Rebel to the</hi> Pope, <hi>who is Chriſt's Vicar on Earth; and that he told them of it on purpoſe that they might have no more Communication with ſuch a Rebel, but might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for their Prelate.</hi> The People ſeemed to be ſatisfied with what he had done,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61585:57"/> and to blame the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> for his obſtinacy. In the Evening he viſited the Sick, and gave large Alms to the Widows and Orphans of the Town, telling them withal, that what he did was their Prelate's duty, and not to take Money from them as their former Biſhops had done; but he forgot to tell them, that whereas their former Prelates had lived altogether upon Alms, having no ſettled Revenues to maintain them, by reaſon of their living under Princes who were <hi>Infidels,</hi> that he had above 20000 Crowns a Year in Rents that were certain. Beſides, by having repreſented what he was doing in the <hi>Serra,</hi> as a great Service to the Crown, he had the Command of the Publick Treaſure at <hi>Goa,</hi> which was never ſo great as at this time; the Viceroy <hi>Don Matthias de Albuquerque</hi> having in the Year 1597 left 80000 Ducats, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Summ in Jewels therein.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Trick,</hi> for it deſerves no better Name, together with his Hectoring of Kings and their <hi>Regedores</hi> as he did, made a great many People wiſh themſelves under <hi>Portugueze</hi> Prelates, who, they ſaw, would not ſuffer their Princes to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over them, but would eſpouſe all their Quarrels, and defend them in their Rights, which was what the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Prelates were not able to do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> now having by the foreſaid Methods brought three ſuch conſiderable places, as <hi>Carturte, Molandurte,</hi> and <hi>Diamper,</hi> beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall Villages, under his Obedience; and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61585:58"/> being alſo ſure of all the Churches that are in the Kingdom of <hi>Porca, Gundara, Marca,</hi> and <hi>Batimena,</hi> whoſe Kings had already Commanded all their Subjects to obey him in every thing: The <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> hearing how things went, began to be ſenſible, that it would not be poſſible for him to contend with ſo powerful an Adverſary much longer; and that he muſt therefore, either ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or be ſent a Priſoner to <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having ſo blocked the <hi>Serra</hi> up to prevent a <hi>Chaldean</hi> Biſhop's coming thither, that it was not poſſible for him to make his eſcape, if he had a mind to run his Country rather than renounce his Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> being informed by a <hi>Caçanar,</hi> that the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> was in great perplexity what he had beſt to do, writ him a long Letter, wherein among other things he cited him <hi>to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Judgment-ſeat of God, to anſwer for the Souls that were now burning in Hell, by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kept them from being reconciled to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, out of which there is no Salvation.</hi> To which Letter the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> returned an anſwer in a ſtrain quite different from what he had writ in formerly.</p>
                  <p>Before this Letter came to his hand, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having done his work at <hi>Diamper,</hi> was ſailed to <hi>Narame,</hi> a conſiderable Village of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which he found all in Arms, having all bound themſelves with an Oath never to forſake their Religion and <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> but to defend them with the laſt drop of their Blood; and ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61585:58"/> when the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was ready to Land to go to Church, they called to him to ſtay where he was; for beſides that, the Church doors were ſhut, there was not one Perſon among them, who would have any Communication with him. Whereupon the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> according to his Cuſtom, ſent immediately to the <hi>Regedor</hi> of the Country, which alſo belonged to the King of <hi>Cochim</hi> to come aboard, for that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to him.</p>
                  <p>What made the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> making ſuch great uſe of Kings and <hi>Regedores,</hi> who were all <hi>Infidels</hi> in the Converſion of theſe Chriſtians to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the more unpardonable, was, that but a little before he had made the <hi>Arch-Deacon's intereſting of</hi> Infidel <hi>Princes in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of</hi> Chriſtianity, with which they were not to be ſuffered to meddle, the chief Article for which he deſerved to be depoſed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Regedor</hi> being come aboard, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> ſpoke to him to go aſhoar, and do as much for him at <hi>Narame,</hi> as the chief <hi>Regedor</hi> had done at <hi>Molandurte</hi> and <hi>Diamper.</hi> The <hi>Regedor</hi> promiſed him he would, but when he came aſhoar to cauſe the Church to be opened, there was no body left in the Town; for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hearing of his coming, and what his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was, had all hid themſelves, that ſo they might not be conſtrained to break the Oath they had made ſo lately. The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> when the <hi>Regedor</hi> brought him word how it was, was in a great Paſſion with him, and would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61585:59"/> but that he had underhand fomented this diviſion. But however theſe Chriſtians came to be incenſed againſt the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> it is certain they were to that degree, that they denied him freſh Proviſions for his Money, ſo that he was forc'd to live upon the <hi>Rice</hi> and <hi>Bisket</hi> that was aboard for ſome days.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was in this Diet, the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi>'s Letter came to his hand, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was, <hi>That he was overcome at laſt by the irreſiſtable force of Truth, and was reſolved to ſubmit himſelf to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, intreating his</hi> Grace <hi>to pardon all the by paſt Errors of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> tho' he was extream glad at the news, would not diſcover that he was, but told the <hi>Caçanar</hi> that brought it very gravely, <hi>That he had been ſo often deceived by the</hi> Arch-Deacon, <hi>that he did not know how to truſt him, and that he never would any more, before he had ſubſcribed the Ten following Articles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That he abjured all the Errors of</hi> Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>and of all his Followers,</hi> Diodorus <hi>and</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus (who, by the way, were both in their Graves before <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was ever heard of) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them to be curſed</hi> Hereticks, <hi>that are burning in Hell for their Errors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That he ſhould confeſs there was but one Chriſtian Law.</hi>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:61585:59"/>III. <hi>That he ſhould ſubſcribe the Confeſſion of Faith, which he ſent to him from</hi> Goa, <hi>when he made him Governour of the Biſhoprick.</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>That he ſhould deliver all the Books of the Dioceſs to be amended or burnt according as they deſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>That he ſhould ſwear Obedience to the</hi> Pope, <hi>as St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Succeſſor, and Chriſt's Vicar upon Earth, and the Supream Head of all Chriſtians, and of all Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops, Primates and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs in the World, ſo that none can be ſaved out of his obedience.</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">X. <hi>That he ſhould accompany the</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>peaceably, whereſoever he went, without any thing of Guards, and ſhould go along with him in his Galley to all the Churches he had a mind to viſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Articles being made and ſigned by the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> he delivered them to the <hi>Caçanar,</hi> together with a Letter, wherein he bid the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> if he was not fully reſolved to ſubſcribe them, allowing him but twenty days to do it in, not to appear before him; and being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſecure himſelf of the fidelity of the Bearer, he obliged him, before he diſmiſs'd him, to ſwear obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ſwear alſo to return, and never to have any thing more to do with the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> in caſe he refuſed to ſign the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
                  <p>Having diſmiſſed this Meſſenger, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> returned to <hi>Cochim,</hi> where his main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was to get the Governour of the place to joyn with him, to preſs the King of <hi>Cochim</hi> to aſſiſt him cordially in his deſign of uniting the Church of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and while he was ſatisfying the Governour of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61585:60"/> what Importance ſuch an Union would be to the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Intereſt in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which was what he himſelf had all along as much in his Eye, as the Governour could have for his Heart: The King having heard of his being in Town, came very opportunely to pay him a viſit, in which, before they parted, the King renewed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to him of commanding all his Chriſtian Subjects to obey him in all things; with which promiſe the Arch-Biſhop returned well ſatisfied to <hi>Cranganor,</hi> in order to ſettle the Affair of the Synod.</p>
                  <p>The day after his arrival there, he had Letters brought him by a <hi>Patamar,</hi> or Currier, from the King of <hi>Samorim,</hi> adviſing him of the King of <hi>Cochim</hi>'s having begun a War upon the <hi>Caimal</hi> or Prince of <hi>Corugeira</hi> his Allie, to which if a ſtop were not put ſuddenly, it would neceſſarily oblige him to withdraw his Army from before <hi>Cunahle,</hi> which was what the King of <hi>Cochim</hi> aimed at. So ſoon as the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> had read theſe Letters, he diſpatched a Currier away im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the King of <hi>Cochim,</hi> who was already on his March, deſiring him not to make a War upon the <hi>Caimal</hi> till after <hi>Cunahle</hi> was taken, ſince it could not be done without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the <hi>Samorim</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Cunahle,</hi> who was then before it, expecting the return of the <hi>Portugueze Armada,</hi> which would be with him in the beginning of the Spring, he writ alſo to the Governour of <hi>Cochim,</hi> and the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Treaſury</hi> to come to

                  <p>Before the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> left <hi>Cranganor,</hi> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter from the <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> wherein he wrote to him, <hi>That, tho' he was ready to ſubſcribe all the Articles he had ſent him, yet that it was not poſſible for him to wait upon His</hi> Grace <hi>in ſo ſhort a time as he had fixed.</hi>

                  <p>The Governour and Commiſſioners having prevailed with the King of <hi>Cochim</hi> to deſiſt from the War; the King, in his return home, reſolved to take <hi>Cranganor</hi> in his way. The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> having received advice that he was ready to Land, was civiler to him than he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and went to the <hi>Caiz,</hi> of the Caſtle to meet him, and after ſome Complements had paſſed on both ſides, they went together to an <hi>Hermitage</hi> that was not far off.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61585:62"/> came about; in confidence of which Protection and Aſſiſtance it was that he left</hi> Goa <hi>to come into thoſe Parts, but that he had found himſelf miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deceived, there not being a Prince in</hi> Malabar, <hi>in whoſe Dominions he had been</hi> (and he had been in the moſt of them) <hi>but what had ſhewed him more favour than His</hi> Highneſs, <hi>who had loaded ſome of his Chriſtian Subjects with Taxes, for no other reaſon, but for having given him a kind Reception.</hi> Here the chief <hi>Regedor</hi> interpoſed, and deſired him <hi>to let His</hi> Majeſty <hi>know what the Affronts or Injuries were that he had received in any part of his Dominions.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with great paſſion, <hi>Sir, There is no Body knows them all better than you do, ſince they were done before your Eyes; however, you were pleaſed to wink at them; nay, I do not know but you might have a hand in procuring them; and therefore pray do not you offer to conceal them from your Maſter.</hi> The King proteſted he had never heard of any Injury or Affront that had been put upon His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in any part of his Territories. The <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> without any Ceremony, told him, <hi>It was not ſo, for that he himſelf had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted His</hi> Highneſs <hi>ſeveral times by Letter, of what he ſuffered from his Subjects, but could never have them remedied as he expected, and as they ought to have been by one that owed ſo much to the</hi> Portugueze <hi>as His</hi> Highneſs <hi>did, wherefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for the future I'll complain of none but my own King, for having ſent me from a Palace at</hi> Goa, <hi>where I lived at my eaſe and in ſplendor, to wander

The King told him he would treat with the Governour of <hi>Cochim</hi> about an <hi>Olla</hi> for his <hi>Lordſhip.</hi> This put the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in a much greater paſſion than he was in before: for he reckoned the King ſlighted him, in ſaying he would treat with the Governour about a thing that was his immediate concern; whereupon he told his <hi>Majeſty, That it had been always his cuſtom to put him off with delays, that for his own part he deſired none of his</hi> Ollas; <hi>and that the Chriſtians of St.</hi> Thomas, <hi>if they had been true Chriſtians, would never have ſuffered their Kings to have meddled with matters of Religion; but eſpecially being</hi> Infidels <hi>and</hi> Idolaters, <hi>as he was, and who not knowing the true God, Worſhipp'd Stocks and Stones, and Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61585:63"/> of him: That for his part he could not but wonder at His</hi> Highneſs<hi>'s taking upon him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Patriarch of</hi> Babylon <hi>againſt the</hi> Pope, <hi>who underſtood nothing of the difference between them; That His</hi> Highneſs <hi>would do well therefore to leave his Chriſtian Subjects to him, who was their true Prelate, and not to meddle with matters he did not underſtand: That as for the</hi> Arch-Deacon <hi>he had determined that if he did not come and ſubmit to him by next</hi> Saturday, <hi>to turn him out of his place, and put another into it, and that he could not but look upon the</hi> Arch-Deacon <hi>as an ill Chriſtian, if for no other reaſon, for that of having communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Affairs of</hi> Chriſtianity <hi>to His</hi> Highneſs, <hi>whom all the World know to be an Infidel.</hi> The King was deſperately angry at what the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> had ſaid of his <hi>Idols;</hi> however being a very wiſe Prince he did not touch upon that ſtring, but told him, His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> might expect the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> one <hi>Saturday,</hi> two <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and three <hi>Saturdays.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> took the words out of his Mouth, and ſtriking his <hi>Cane</hi> againſt the Ground in great Fury, ſaid, <hi>I will not expect him one, two, and three</hi> Saturdays, <hi>but if I live I will depoſe him if he does not come and ſubmit before the next, and that he deſerved to be Depoſed, if for no other reaſon, for his having intereſted His</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>in the concerns of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knew him to be an</hi> Infidel. The King, who could not help ſtanding amazed at the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> condemning the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> ſo much for endeavouring to intereſt him in a thing which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61585:63"/> he himſelf at the ſame time was ſwaggering him into, perceiving that the more they talked, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> grew the more furious, and talked the louder, put on a pleaſant Countenance, and told him with great ſweetneſs, <hi>That there was nothing he had ever ſtudied ſo much as to pleaſe His Lordſhip.</hi> With this the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething mitigated, he replied, <hi>It was what he had always expected from His</hi> Highneſs, <hi>and that he hoped he would not wonder to ſee him put into ſo great a Paſſion, in a caſe wherein Chriſtianity was ſo much concerned, for the leaſt of whoſe Intereſt he was bound in duty to ſacrifice his Head.</hi> The King told him, <hi>That if he knew of any that ſought after his Head, they ſhould not keep their own long upon their Shoulders.</hi> After they had made an end of this hot buſineſs, they talked for ſome time of indifferent matters; and when the King was for going, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> accompanied him to the <hi>Caiz,</hi> where they are ſaid to have parted very good Friends; which if they did, the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how he had been treated, was certainly the beſt natured Prince that ever wore a Crown, and in a very ſubſtantial point a much better Chriſtian than the <hi>Arch-Biſhop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rancounter was of no ſmall advantage to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in the reduction of that <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> for the King fearing to provoke one of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Character and Temper, ſo ſoon as he had left him, writ away immediately to the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> to come and ſubmit himſelf to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> he writ alſo to the King of <hi>Mangate,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61585:64"/> in caſe he found the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> not willing to do it, to oblige him to it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the receipt of this Letter the <hi>Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> ſent away immediately to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> to let him know, That he was ready to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his <hi>Grace</hi>'s Feet, and to obey all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and that within the time he had prefixed; but withal, deſired to wait upon him ſome where elſe than in <hi>Cranganor,</hi> which being a Fortreſs belonging to the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> he was afraid to truſt himſelf in, there being nothing that he dreaded ſo much as being ſome time or other kidnapped for <hi>Goa.</hi> However the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> complyed ſo far with his Fears as to order him to meet him at the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>-College in <hi>Vaipicotta.</hi> They met firſt in the Church, where the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> threw himſelf at the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Feet, with the words of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> in his mouth, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. I do humbly beg Pardon for all my Errors, which have been great.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> lifting him up and embracing him tenderly, told him, all that was paſt was forgot; and that God's Mercy in reducing him to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> was greater than the Malice of the Devil, which had been the cauſe of his returning no ſooner, that he would certainly have that great Reward that is reſerved in Heaven for thoſe that bring ſo many Souls to the purity of the Faith, as he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he would do by his Example; that he would therefore have him ſubſcribe the Profeſſion of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61585:64"/> Faith and ten Articles immediately. The <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> beg'd to ſpeak one word firſt with His <hi>Grace</hi> in private, promiſing, after that to do whatſoever His <hi>Grace</hi> ſhould command him; and being alone, he told him, That if His <hi>Grace</hi> would have it ſo, he was ready to ſubſcribe the Profeſſion and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles publickly, tho', with ſubmiſſion he thought it would be better if he would allow him to do it in private, for the ſake of that Chriſtianity who were not as yet ſo well inſtructed as they ought to be; but that before the meeting of the Synod, at which he promiſed to ſign them publickly, he hoped to be able to prepare them for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of whatſoever ſhould be therein determined, which he believed he ſhould be able to do the more effectually, if they knew nothing of his having already ſubmitted to the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> anſwered, <hi>That notwithſtanding a Profeſſion of the Faith was by ſo much the better, as it was the more publick, nevertheleſs he ſo far approved of his Reaſon as to diſpenſe with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it openly.</hi> Whereupon they and the Jeſuite <hi>Franciſco Roz</hi> repaired to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and having ſhut the doors, the <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> kneeled down before a <hi>Crucifix</hi> that ſtood on the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi>'s Table, and laying his hands upon the <hi>Miſſal,</hi> ſwore to the Ten Articles, and to the Profeſſion of Faith, to which the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> obliged him to put his hand, to prevent his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning all the <hi>Caçanares</hi> being called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> acquainted them with his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61585:65"/> intention of calling a Synod very ſpeedily, which they all agreed to. It was then debated where it ſhould meet, ſome were for its being held at <hi>Angamale,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Dioceſs, but the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> would not hear of its being held there for three Reaſons; the firſt was, That the Chriſtians of <hi>Angamale</hi> were the Chriſtians of the whole Biſhoprick that were moſt addicted to their old Religion, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was not in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the King of <hi>Cochim,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Malabar</hi> that had the greateſt dependence upon the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes;</hi> And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Becauſe it was at too great a diſtance from the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Garriſon of <hi>Cochim.</hi> It was carried therefore that it ſhould be held in the Town of <hi>Diamper,</hi> which was but a little way from <hi>Cochim,</hi> and ſhould begin on the 20th. of <hi>June,</hi> being the 3d. <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In purſuance whereof the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> did both iſſue forth their <hi>Ollas,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Prieſts and Procurators of the People, who were four from every Town, to aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Town of <hi>Diamper,</hi> on the 20th. of <hi>June</hi> next, there to celebrate a Dioceſan Synod. The <hi>Ollas</hi> bore date the 11th. of <hi>May,</hi> ſo that there were ſix Weeks allowed for the preparing of buſineſs, which the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> made good uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> left <hi>Vaipicotta,</hi> the <hi>Caimal</hi> of <hi>Angamale,</hi> who was called the <hi>black King</hi> of <hi>Malabar,</hi> came to give him a viſit: The <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> received him kindly, and at parting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with ſome pieces of very rich Cloath;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61585:65"/> which was what he went well furniſhed withal from <hi>Goa,</hi> having laid out 18000 <hi>Pardaos</hi> in Goods, to make Preſents of in the <hi>Serra.</hi> The <hi>Caimal,</hi> who was a boiſterous and bloody Prince, was ſo well pleaſed with his Preſent, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> to ſee him obeyed in all things.</p>
                  <p>After which the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> returned to <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganor,</hi> where he compoſed the Decrees of the Synod, which were all writ with his own Hand, word for word as they are publiſhed. As ſoon as he had finiſhed them he had them tranſlated out of <hi>Portugueze</hi> into <hi>Malavar.</hi> He likewiſe Conſecrated there a Stone Altar for every Church in the <hi>Serra,</hi> which was what they all wanted.</p>
                  <p>What remained to be done, after having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged all the Neighbouring Princes, and their <hi>Regedors</hi> to aſſiſt him, was to ſecure the <hi>Major</hi> Vote in the Synod; and in order thereunto he Ordained no fewer than fifty Prieſts on <hi>Trinity-Sunday,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Paru,</hi> which fifty being added to the thirty eight he had Ordained but a little before at <hi>Diamper,</hi> and to thoſe he had Ordained at <hi>Carturte,</hi> who are ſaid to have been many, muſt make up at leaſt two thirds of the Prieſts that were preſent at the Synod, who in all were but 153. of which two thirds the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> was ſecure, having before he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them, made them abjure their old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſubſcribe the Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> IV.</p>
                  <p>He was alſo induſtrious to ſecure to himſelf the Votes of ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable among
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61585:66"/> the <hi>Procurators,</hi> by making them great Preſents, giving to one of them a Croſs ſet with <hi>Diamonds</hi> of great value, as he did another of equal price, to an old <hi>Caçanar,</hi> who had been a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Mar Abraham.</hi> Upon which, and the other Precautions made uſe of by the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> to compaſs his ends in the Synod, Father <hi>Simon</hi> in his 109 Pag. of his <hi>Hiſtorie Critique,</hi> makes the following judicious reflection: <hi>All that theſe methods have hitherto produced, ſerves only to let the World ſee by what means the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion has been eſtabliſhed in the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>which he that knows will not wonder, that all the re-unions which have been made with thoſe People we call</hi> Schiſmaticks <hi>in thoſe Parts, have been ſo ſhort lived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 9th. of <hi>June</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſix <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and his Confeſſor, who were all Divines, and ſeveral <hi>Caçanares,</hi> arrived at <hi>Diamper,</hi> where he immediately erected a <hi>Junto</hi> of eight of the moſt popular <hi>Caçanares,</hi> before whom he laid the Decrees, deſiring their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; and when they came to conſider the Decrees relating to manners, he called four of the graveſt of the <hi>Procurators</hi> alſo to be preſent at the Examination of them; after ſome Debates the Decrees were all agreed to by the <hi>Junto,</hi> which, for that reaſon, was given out to be the Author of them.</p>
                  <p>On the 20th. of <hi>June</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THE following Synod is printed at the end of the Hiſtory of <hi>Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Goa</hi>'s Viſitation of the Chriſtians of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Serra</hi> or Mountain of <hi>Malabar,</hi> made immediately after the Celebration, and in purſuance of the Order of the ſaid Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; the Hiſtory of which Viſitation was compos'd by <hi>Antonio de Gouvea,</hi> an <hi>Auſtin Friar,</hi> and Reader of Divinity in <hi>Goa,</hi> at the Command of the Provincial of his Order in <hi>Portugal.</hi> It contains divers things that are fit for all Proteſtants to know; namely, the rude and boiſterous Methods, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates, where they may do it with ſafety, make uſe of in the Reduction of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:61585:69"/> they call <hi>Hereticks;</hi> together with clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of the Truth of what we meet with in the Fourteenth, and other Decrees of the Third Action of this Synod; to wit, That the Three great Doctrines of Popery, the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> were never believed nor practiſed at any time in this ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Church; but, on the contrary, were rejected and condemned by her, and that in her Publick Offices. So that upon what we learn from this Synod and Hiſtory, I think one may venture to ſay, That before the time of the late Reformation, there was no Church that we know of, no not that of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> abating that one thing of her being infected with the Hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> of which too ſhe is cleared by one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, that had ſo Few Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Doctrine, as the Church of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Synod I here publiſh ſhould be well received, as I have reaſon to hope it will, by all Proteſtants, and lovers of Truth, upon the account of the clear Diſcoveries
<pb facs="tcp:61585:69"/> it makes of the forementioned Popiſh Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, having never been at any time the Doctrines of the Univerſal Church, which we know is confidently affirmed, and much boaſted of; and for further ſatisfaction in ſo important a Matter, the above-named Hiſtory ſhould be deſired, I ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to tranſlate and publiſh it with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, alone, and in the ſame Volume with this of the Synod; together with the beſt Account I can procure of the Church of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and the other Oriental Churches, that were never within the Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; for it is in thoſe Churches that we are to expect to meet with the leaſt of the Leaven of Popery.</p>
                  <p>As to the Synod, to prevent all ſurmiſes of its being a Piece either forged by ſome Proteſtant, or of no Authority in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' ſet forth by a Member of her Communion; I have, together with the whole Title Page, which tells where, when, and by whom it was printed, tranſlated and publiſhed all the <hi>Licences</hi> that it came out with: And if any ſhould ſuſpect the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb facs="tcp:61585:70"/> if they pleaſe, they may ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of its Fidelity, by having recourſe to the Original in the <hi>Bodleian Library</hi> at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> to which, as the ſafeſt, as well as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Repoſitory of Books in the World, I deſign to give it.</p>
                  <p>I have here and there added ſome ſhort Remarks upon ſome Paſſages, which will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                        <p>The ſecond is, That all things come neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſs, or through<note n="*" place="bottom">I am very apt to believe that they are here falſely accuſed of attributing all things to Fate, for no other reaſon but becauſe they believed Predeſtination; which if it was ſo, Arch-Biſhop <hi>Menezes,</hi> who was himſelf an <hi>Auſtin</hi> Fryar, ſhewed but little reſpect to the Memory of his pretended Father, in making Predeſtination and Fate to be equally deſtructive of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Liberty.</note> Fate or Fortune, which they call the Nativity of Men, who they ſay are compelled to be what they are, and that there is no help for it; which is a manifeſt Error, and condemned by Holy Mother Church, for as much as it deſtroys that Liberty of Will, with which God created us, leaving us in the power of our own Will, to do Good or Evil, to obey his Holy Inſpirations and Internal Motions, by which he excites to Good, or to reſiſt Evil; ſo that as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his Divine mercy and goodneſs to move us to Good, ſo it depends on our Free-Will, whether by his aſſiſtance we will obey thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, and will profit our ſelves of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motions, or of our own free Will refuſe to do it; or in a word, do Well, or Ill; ſo that if we periſh for doing any thing that is Ill, it is the fault of our own Free-Will; as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith teaches us; and not from the fate of our Nativity, as the ignorant Heathens will have it.</p>

                        <p>In the Book called the <hi>Great Breviary,</hi> it is ſaid, That the Divine Word did not aſſume Fleſh, ignorantly pretending to prove it thus; becauſe if the Word had aſſumed Fleſh, to what purpoſe was the Holy Spirit's overſhadowing the Virgin? In the ſame Breviary the whole Office of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is Heretical, it being every where affirmed therein, that Chriſt had two Perſons, and calling

                        <p>In the Book of Prayers for the great Faſt, it is frequently ſaid, that there were two Perſons, a Divine and Humane in Chriſt.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61585:131"/> preference, all which are intolerable diſorders, and ſuch ſcandalous abominations as the Church ought not by any means to give way to, and which might be eaſily prevented, if People could but be perſwaded to bring their Children to be Chriſtened upon the eighth day, it being their deferring of their Baptiſm ſo long, that is the cauſe of ſo many coming together; wherefore for the removing of theſe diſorders in the Church, the Synod doth command that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be baptized as they come, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of firſt or laſt, and that the Prieſts do accuſtom themſelves, either to baptize the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt firſt, or all indifferently; and the Vicar or Prieſt that ſhall be found to have taken Money, or any Fee, before or after Baptiſm, tho' it ſhould be voluntarily offer'd, and of never ſo ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, or only what is to be Eat, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of Simony, and puniſhed according to the Canons.</p>

                              <p>I do not except the Papacy, becauſe when it was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIIth. was reſolved to condemn <hi>Molina</hi>'s Book of <hi>Scientia Media,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Jeſuits endeavoured to ward off that blow, by affirming in their publick Concluſions in their College at <hi>Complutum,</hi> that it was not a matter of Faith, to believe that <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIIth. was true Pope; for which <hi>Luiſius Turrianus</hi> the Preſident of the Diſputation, the Rector of the College, and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> who were preſent at the Act, were all ſummoned to appear before the Inquiſition of <hi>Toledo,</hi> as <hi>Gaſpar Hortadus, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry de la Camara,</hi> and <hi>Alvarez de Villegas,</hi> were to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> before the Pope, for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the ſame Concluſion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the ſaid Univerſity much about the ſame time; ſo that had <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIIth. condemned <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>'s Book after the whole order of the Jeſuits had eſpouſed the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thereof ſo publickly, which the <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſay he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have done, had he but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a few Months longer, <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Loyola</hi> appearing to ſome Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its in <hi>Spain,</hi> and aſſuring them that <hi>Molina</hi>'s Book would never be condemned by any Pope notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; we ſhould have had Simony, or ſome other Nullity found in his Election by the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its before this time: By this we ſee that Jeſuits have wherewith to intimidate Popes, as well as Princes and Biſhops.</p>

The Form of this Sacrament is, <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> to which neceſſary words the Church has thought fit to add the words following, <hi>from all thy Sins, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> There are alſo ſome Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which the Prieſt ſaith immediately after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Penitent, which, tho' they are not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the form, yet are very profitable and healthful for the Penitent. Now by pronouncing the form, not only all the Sins that are confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but all thoſe likewiſe which after a due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Examination of the Conſcience do not occurr to the Memory, ſo as to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all ſuch being included in the ſaid Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are all pardoned; tho' with an obligation of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61585:160"/> confeſſing them, if they ſhould ever after come to be remembred, ſins being as it were chains to the Soul, from which it is delivered by the abſolution of the Prieſt, which is applicable to ſuch, as by virtue of contrition joyned with a deſire of confeſſing, have obtained pardon of God for their Sins, which they were under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to have confeſſed: as alſo to thoſe Sins which were never confeſſed, becauſe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred after a due diligence, and to thoſe likewiſe which having been once lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and truly pardoned, are by the Penitent of his own accord, and for the greater Penance confeſſed and ſubmitted to the Keys ſeveral times. The Miniſter of this Sacrament is a Prieſt, <hi>who hath Authority to abſolve,</hi> and is either the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> as the Prelates, or ſuch as are commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approved of by them.

The Synod doth likewiſe condemn what has been formerly commanded in this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, which was, that in certain Caſes Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents were not to be abſolved, but at the hour of Death, and in ſome not then neither, which is contrary to Chriſtian Charity, and the Rules of the Church, who as a Pious Mother at all times receives true Penitents, and never ſhuts the Gates of Salvation againſt any of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: So that let their Crimes be never ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, yet upon their doing Penance, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a deep ſorrow for their Sins, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſatisfaction that is impoſed upon them, they are graciouſly received, and made free at

                        <p>THe ſixth Sacrament is that of <hi>Order,</hi> which was inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the day before he ſuffered for us, after that he had made an end of inſtituting the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, that ſo he might inſtitute the Sacrifice and the Prieſts that were to offer it together; at which time he created the Apoſtles Prieſts, giving them withal power to conſecrate others, that ſo the Sacrifice and the Prieſthood might be continued in the Church till the end of the World. The Matter of this Sacrament is that which is delivered to the Perſon that is ordained, for the exerciſe of that Order he has received; to the Prieſts, a Cup with Wine in it, and a Patten with Bread; to a Deacon the Book of the Goſpels; and to a Sub-Deacon an empty Cup and Patten, and ſo as to the other inferiour Orders: The Form of the Prieſthood and other Orders, are the words ſpoke by the Biſhop when he
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61585:172"/> delivers to every one that which belongs to his Miniſtry and the exerciſe of his Order. The Miniſter of this Sacrament is only a Biſhop, to whom only Chriſt committed the power of Conſecrating Prieſts; the effect of it is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Grace, to the end that the Perſon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained may be a fit Miniſter. This Sacrament was inſtituted by Chriſt as highly neceſſary in his Church; for a Sacrifice and Prieſthood are ſo join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the one cannot be without the other; wherefore ſince under the New Teſtament the viſible. Sacrifice of the Holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was to be inſtituted, it became therefore neceſſary, that there ſhould be a new, viſible and eternal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the ſame Church, whereby the ancient Prieſthood of the Old Law was tranſlated; and there were Prieſts provided accordingly for the Offering of the Divine Sacrifice; which Prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully ordained, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has given them power over his true and real Body, to Conſecrate, Offer, and Adminiſter it, as alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Myſtical Body the Church; giving them power to pardon and retain Sins; to which power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond is, for a remedy for Uncleanneſs; and that ſuch as are inclined to that Vice, might have a remedy given them by God, ſo that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with their Wives, they might not fall into that Sin, from whence it is that People may not only Marry once, but as often as one of the Parties dies, becauſe this end of Matrimony may not only be compaſſed in the firſt, but equally in the ſubſequent Marriages; wherefore the Church deteſts thoſe as Hereticks, who condemn ſecond Marriages, holding them to be unlawful; as ſome Hereticks did anciently; and as ſome of the moſt Superſtitious Heathens do at this day in theſe Parts; from whence it may alſo be collected, that this Sacrament may not only be lawfully ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated betwixt Perſons capable of having Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but alſo betwixt thoſe, who according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, cannot have any, becauſe the ſecond end may be anſwered in ſuch Marriages; but where neither the one nor the other end can be anſwered, as in Children, for whom the Church has ſet a certain time, and in ſuch as are under a Natural Impotency that will laſt as long as they live, as to Matrimonial Acts, Matrimony is not to be celebrated: And
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61585:187"/> tho' both under the Law of Nature and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there were Diſpenſations whereby Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was made to deviate from its firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſome of the Patriarchs having had ſeveral Wives at once by a Divine Diſpenſation, and the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> having permitted Divorces, or the repudiating of Wives, yet under the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Law, by which Matrimony was perfected and reſtored again to its firſt Eſtate and Purity, it is prohibited for a Man to have more than one Wife at a time, and to turn away his Wife and take another ſo long as ſhe lives. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Marriage are three principally; the firſt is the Generation and Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the Worſhip and Service of the true God; the ſecond is the Fidelity which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried couple ought to keep to one another; and the third is the Perpetuity of Matrimony, which, in that it cannot be diſſolved, ſignifies that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Conjunction and Union that is betwixt Chriſt and his Church: And notwithſtanding for the cauſe of Fornication or Adultery, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Married couple to part as to Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, yet it is not lawful to Marry with any other, becauſe the Bond of Matrimony, being once lawfully tied, is Perpetual, and cannot be diſſolved by any thing but the death of one of the Parties.</p>

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:61585:248"/> wanting to our Duty in theſe Matters, it did not proceed from any Obſtinacy of Mind, or from any Inclination we had to be Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks, but purely for want of the Light of true Doctrine and healthful and Catholick Food, which was not given us by our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, but who did inſtead thereof, poyſon us with the falſe Doctrines of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and ſeveral other Errors; from which we are now, by the Divine Mercy, reſcued; and by the goodneſs of God, and the Miniſtry of our <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> enlightened: from whence alſo roſe the Rebellion which was made by us, when the Truth began to be firſt preached to us; as alſo all the Troubles and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that we gave to our <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and the manifeſt Dangers we expoſed him to; for all which we are now heartily ſorry, and do dayly more and more lament it: But whereas God has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to enlighten us with his Doctrine, the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> being diſcouraged by none of thoſe things to go on preaching in our Churches, the light of the Truth coming to us by that means, we have cordially embraced, and have with an unanimous conſent and great alacrity, made profeſſion thereof in this Synod; having alſo put the Affairs of our Church in the beſt Order we were able, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſelves to the Judgment of our <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Mar Aleixo,</hi> who as our Maſter, has inſtructed us in all things: But whereas his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, after his Viſitation of this Dioceſs is over, is to go to reſide in his<note n="*" place="bottom">

And ſeeing your moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in your Charity has been pleaſed to favour us with a Letter, we take confidence from thence, to beg of you, That whereas our Prieſts, both for their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Conſolation, and other Neceſſities, do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſort to your City and ſeveral parts of your Dioceſs, where it will be neceſſary for them to ſay Maſs, which they have hitherto been hindred from doing, by reaſon of their not being in a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Holy Mother Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> we now being in ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, as much as can be deſired, the Synod doth humbly beſeech your

                     <pb facs="tcp:61585:250"/> of the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in which he purged the Church of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereſies, and reduced it to the Obedience of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church; one of the chief was the reforming the <hi>Syrian</hi> Maſs, which was ſaid in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue in this Biſhoprick, which having been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or inlarged by <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereticks, was full of Errors and Blaſphemies both in the Prayers and Commemorations of <hi>Neſtorius, Theodorus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereticks, to whom as to Saints, they prayed, for to intercede for them: And whereas this People was in a profound Ignorance, nay the very Biſhops, who came from <hi>Babylon,</hi> not knowing the true Form of Conſecration, all of them adding to it and taking from it at their pleaſure; there being no certain particular Form of Conſecration among them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a certain Arch-Biſhop came who had more knowledge than the reſt in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Matters, and the Holy Scriptures; who perceiving that the Form wherewith they Conſecrated, contained in it ſome
<pb facs="tcp:61585:251"/> Errors, contrary to the Truth of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrament, did eſtabliſh the true Form, adding ſome words to it, both in the Conſecration of the Body and Blood, in contradiction to the Error and Hereſie of thoſe who ſay that the Sacrament is <hi>only the Figure of the Body of Chriſt our Lord.</hi> From whence it is more than probable, the Hereticks of our Times, the revivers of the Errors of all the ancient condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sects, took this Opinion: The Form eſtabliſhed by the forementioned Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was, <hi>This is in truth my Body; this is in truth the Cup of my Blood, which was ſhed for you and for many, for the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remiſſion of your Sins; and this ſhall be a Pledge to you for ever and ever;</hi> in which Form they have now Conſecrated for ſeveral Years. But the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Arch-Biſhop Primate, having remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the words that are not neceſſary, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed the proper Form uſed in the Catholick Church, as it is in the <hi>Roman Miſſal,</hi> laying aſide divers and Sacrilegious and ignorant Ceremonies alſo, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb facs="tcp:61585:251"/> ſome Hereſies and Errors that were amongſt them: And having thus refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their <hi>Maſs,</hi> he continued it however in its ancient Form, until ſuch time as he had conſulted the Apoſtolical <hi>See</hi> about it, to know what our Lord the Pope would determine in that Matter; many of the emendations are noted in the Synod, <hi>Dec.</hi> 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. of the Holy Sacrifice of the Maſs, and in the Action of Matters of Faith, where they are to be ſeen; I ſhall here preſent the Curious only with the <hi>Maſs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and as its ſaid among them at this time.</p>
